# The factory

Builds the packages no upstream ships — for the architectures the pool serves
but nobody else covers (today: what the OPR only builds for x86_64, on
aarch64), and, later, the AUR names Omarchy installs. It lives in this
repository for now; it is designed to move out (see *The contract* and
[docs/MIGRATION.md](../docs/MIGRATION.md)).

The pool is the brain. GitHub holds PKGBUILDs and runs CI; it orchestrates
nothing. Workers are ephemeral, live anywhere, and pull.

Contributors and maintainers use the same tools; maintainers never ship a
contributor's bytes — *we do not use what you built, we learn from it*
([Governance](https://omarchy-pool.firemanxbr.org/docs/governance)). A contributor's build is
evidence: the recipe, the log, the manifest that let a maintainer rebuild,
verify and attest the package faster and approve it with more confidence.

![The pool is the brain; workers are ephemeral, live anywhere and pull. A contributor's build is evidence, staged for the audit and the trial; the pool's own build of an approved package is what reaches the rings.](diagram:factory-loop)

## A package's life

1. **Someone requests it.** A contributor signs in and asks, on the
   dashboard: the project's URL (a GitHub repository or its release tarball
   — for a project elsewhere, its home page and the release's source and
   version), a name, one line of description, the licence (SPDX), the
   architectures, and four things they confirm. The pool checks all of
   it — a blocked contributor, a name or a project already in the pool,
   an upstream that ships the name, a source that does not answer — and
   only then writes the request **once** to the record,
   `factory/<name>/<id>/request.json` in the pool bucket with the pool's
   detached signature, public and immutable (`worker/src/record.ts`).
   Nothing about a request lives on GitHub. The build starts by itself,
   in the shared queue: the best idle shared worker of the architecture
   — anyone's, with its owner's agent — or one of the contributor's own,
   at once. The four things, as the form asks them:
<!-- checklist -->
2. **Does someone ship it already?** The pool is asked first. If Arch, Arch
   Linux ARM or the OPR ship the name for an architecture it enters the pool's
   cycle as it is; the factory refuses to build that architecture
   (`override:true` exists for the deliberate case). It only builds what is
   missing.
3. **The PKGBUILD is drafted, not written**, when none is given:
   `factory/bin/draft-pkgbuild` in the worker reads the repository (metadata,
   latest release, build files, README) and asks the owner's agent for the
   PKGBUILD following `factory/prompts/pkgbuild.md` — `factory/bin/agent.py`
   speaks to Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini or xAI by the key set
   (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`;
   `FACTORY_MODEL` picks the model) — or runs Claude Code in print mode on
   a Claude subscription (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, from `claude
   setup-token`; the dashboard's *Run a worker* page has the steps) — the
   worker owner's key, never the pool's; without one a template covers Rust,
   Go, CMake, Meson, autotools and prebuilt release binaries. `updpkgsums`
   fills the checksums and `namcap` lints, in the container.
4. **It is built before anyone reviews it — and it passes the gate.** The
   worker builds it in its fresh container; a failure feeds the log back to
   the drafter for a corrected PKGBUILD — three attempts. Then the gate
   (*The gate*, below): the checks every package must pass, run by the
   worker on what it just built, the transcript in `tests.log`, the verdict
   in `vet.json`. A failing gate is a failed build (final, never retried
   by the pool; the drafter gets one turn with the verdict as the log). The
   package, the PKGBUILD, the log and the gate land in the contributor's
   staging workspace as **evidence**, and the evidence — never the package
   — is copied to the record, `factory/<name>/<request>/build-<task>/`,
   signed; nothing is published.
5. **The second agent reads it.** Staging the build queues an `audit`: a
   project worker whose owner set an agent key reads the PKGBUILD, the log
   and the `.PKGINFO`, asks the model for a structured review
   (`factory/bin/audit-pkgbuild`, `factory/prompts/audit.md`) and attaches
   `audit.json` / `audit.md` to the evidence. The Review page shows the
   verdict (`ok`, `warn`, `block`); nothing acts on it, the maintainer does.
6. **A maintainer has the project build it — never their own package.** On
   the Review page, a maintainer (`factory/MAINTAINERS.toml`) reads the
   evidence and presses *Build by the project* (or rejects with
   a note). A review worker takes the task (`review:<task>`): the project's
   agent gets the request and the contributor's PKGBUILD, log, gate and
   audit as the lesson — `draft-pkgbuild --evidence` — and writes the
   project's own recipe from the project's sources; the same gate runs;
   the packages, the recipe, the log, the gate go to the project's staging
   space (`staging/@project/…`) and the evidence to the record; its own
   audit is queued — and its **trial**: a pool worker of that architecture
   puts the package into the pool under the factory's directory and pins it
   into the **lab** (the fourth ring: nothing there is promised or
   promoted), renders the lab, and a real pacman in a clean container
   installs it from the lab above `edge` (`tests/trial.sh`): dependencies
   from `edge`, hooks run, files verified. The transcript goes beside the
   evidence (`trial.log`); the Review page shows *installs* or what stopped
   it. Nothing is published yet.
7. **A maintainer approves the project's build.** With the project's
   evidence in front of them (the Review page shows both rows), a
   maintainer — not the owner — approves. The approval is the decision on
   the record and a `publish` job: a project worker fetches the staged
   packages with the job's token, publishes them into `edge` as source
   `factory` (the pool signs), renders, and the brain marks the
   registration `published`, links the approval to the build and writes
   the seal next to the object. **The fast lane:** when the trial installed
   the build (its verdict was `ok`), the publish job pins the same objects
   into `rc` and `stable` as well, renders them, and records a `fast-track`
   — the maintainer decided the build, the evidence decides the speed; a
   build whose trial did not run or did not pass reaches `rc` and `stable`
   by promotion like everything else. Only the sizing recipes
   (`factory/sizing`, benchmarks) take the `enqueue` door without a staged
   build; every package comes in through a request.
8. **After that: bumps are evidence too.** Once a day the brain asks GitHub
   for each approved package's latest release and queues a community build
   from the contributor's staged PKGBUILD with `pkgver` moved to the tag
   (`bump:<task>@<tag>`) — for the owner's worker first, for any `--shared`
   worker after 14 days — and a maintainer reviews it like the first time.
   30 days without a build and the package is *unmaintained* until someone
   takes it (docs/GOVERNANCE.md). There is no second path: the project's own
   recipes left the repository on 2026-09-17, and nothing in the factory's
   operation goes through GitHub Actions, issues or pull requests.
9. **A worker builds it.** Any worker of that architecture claims the task,
   holds a lease, builds in its fresh container, publishes the result
   into `edge` as source `factory` — the pool signs it with its own key —
   and renders the edge databases. From there
   it is a package like any other: health checks, the soak, `rc`, `stable`,
   the security layer, `omarchy-cli`.
10. **If it fails**, the task returns to the queue with the log tail; after
   three attempts it is marked failed and the build's page shows why. A
   worker that dies mid-build loses its lease and the task is requeued by the
   pool's scheduler within ten minutes.

The asker's own page follows a request per architecture, in the
registration's own words: `registered`, then `waiting` or `building`,
`staged` when the worker hands the evidence in, a maintainer's decision
(`approved`, `rejected`) and `published` once the project's build is in
edge — `unmaintained` after 30 days without a build; the
[Pipeline](../../../../pipeline) lists every request and where it stands.

## The gate

What the factory asks of every package, on both sides of the review —
the contributor's build and the project's — run by the worker in the
container that built it (`factory/worker/omarchy-build-worker.sh`,
`vet_package`), after the checks the omarchy-aur-factory runs. `fail`
fails the build; `warn` is for the audit and the maintainer to weigh.

| Check | What it asks | fail when |
|---|---|---|
| checksums | every source pinned (`updpkgsums` fills them) | a `SKIP` for a source that is not a VCS |
| shellcheck | `shellcheck --shell=bash` on the PKGBUILD (SC2034, SC2154, SC2164 excluded: makepkg's own) | an error |
| namcap-pkgbuild | `namcap PKGBUILD` | an `E:` |
| namcap-package | `namcap -m -i` on every built package: dependencies the ELF scan finds (glibc excepted), sonames, permissions, paths, `$srcdir` leaks, the licence file — `unused-sodepend` on the dynamic loader is the linker's and not weighed; *namcap-libmap* warns when the scan found no package for libc itself — the map is blind on that worker | an `E:` other than an ELF under `/opt` |
| files | `pacman -Qlp`: only `/usr`, `/etc`, `/opt` | anything under `/usr/local`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`, `/home`, `/tmp`; a `.la`; an empty package |
| metadata | `pacman -Qip`: `pkgdesc`, `license`, `url` | no description or licence |
| check | a `check()` running the upstream tests, or a comment saying why not | never (a warning) |
| smoke | `pacman -U` in the fresh container, then every binary the package puts in `/usr/bin` started once (`--version`, then `--help`) | the install is refused, or a binary cannot start (a missing library, exit 126/127, a signal) |

shellcheck comes from pacman where it exists and from the pinned static
release (`SHELLCHECK_VERSION`, checksum verified) on Arch Linux ARM, which
does not ship it; without it the gate says so and goes on. The audit (the
second agent) reads `tests.log` beside the PKGBUILD and the log, so it
weighs what the gate found instead of rediscovering it; the Review page
shows the gate's verdict next to the audit's.

## Contribute a package

You have something to package for Omarchy. No permission needed, nothing
spent by the project until a maintainer approves a build: you register the
package, you run the worker (on your machine, with your tokens), the result
waits in your staging workspace.

```bash
API=https://pkgs.firemanxbr.org/api/v1

# 1. Who you are — a GitHub token is used once to read your login and never stored
#    (a fine-grained token with no permissions, made for this; never `gh auth token`).
curl -s -X POST $API/factory/register -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"github_token\":\"github_pat_…\"}"
#    → {"login":"you","token":"omc_…"}   keep it: export OMC=omc_…

# 2. Request the package: the pool checks nobody ships it, that the source answers, and writes the request to the record.
curl -s -X POST $API/factory/packages -H "authorization: Bearer $OMC" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://github.com/you/project","description":"What it does, one line","license":"MIT",
       "checklist":{"official":true,"license":true,"unshipped":true,"evidence":true}}'
#    optional: "name", "arches"; for a project not on GitHub: "source" (the release tarball) and "version"
#    → {"package":…,"request":{"id":12,"record":"https://pool.firemanxbr.org/factory/<name>/12/request.json",…},
#       "build":{"tasks":[57],"queue":{"aarch64":{"position":2,"total":3}},…}}   — queued at once, in the shared queue

# 3. Register a worker (optional: the request above is already in the shared queue). It builds your packages at once; started with WORKER_SHARED=1 it builds everyone's queue too.
curl -s -X POST $API/factory/workers -H "authorization: Bearer $OMC" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"laptop","arch":"aarch64"}'
#    → {"worker":"you-laptop-ab12","token":"omw_…"}   shown once

# 4. Queue the build(s).
curl -s -X POST $API/factory/packages/project/build -H "authorization: Bearer $OMC"

# 5. Run the worker: one command, wherever it lives (docker or podman, with compose). It writes the compose
#    file and a .env, pulls the project's signed image and starts the set — the broker holds the token, your
#    agent's key and GITHUB_TOKEN and only receives, processes and answers; the builder beside it is born with
#    nothing, builds one task in a fresh container and exits (/docs/workers#secrets); the updater keeps both on
#    the pool's latest image (every worker follows it: /docs/workers#update).
#    GITHUB_TOKEN: the drafter reads GitHub's API for every package (the release, the files) through the
#    broker — without one, 60 requests an hour from your address; a fine-grained token with no permissions.
#    the agent key (--anthropic-key, --openai-key, --gemini-key or --xai-key — or --claude-token, a Claude
#    subscription through Claude Code) is *yours*, on the broker: the pool never holds one.
#    A worker is ready only when its agent answers the probe (the broker's /health): no agent, no draft.
curl -fsSLo omarchy-worker https://omarchy-pool.firemanxbr.org/omarchy-worker && chmod +x omarchy-worker
./omarchy-worker start --token omw_… --github-token github_pat_… --anthropic-key sk-…
./omarchy-worker status                                  # what runs, what the pool thinks; logs · share on · update · stop
#    by hand, the same set: the compose file (served at /omarchy-worker/compose.yml) and a .env beside it —
#    OMARCHY_WORKER_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN, the agent key, COMPOSE_PROFILES=community and OMARCHY_WORKER_DIR=$PWD
#    (the updater mounts the directory at the same path) — then `docker compose up -d` (podman compose the same).
# 6. Follow it.
curl -s $API/factory/me -H "authorization: Bearer $OMC"       # your packages, workers, tasks, staging quota
```

What happens: the worker claims your task (a dedicated worker only ever
sees your packages; a shared one takes any community task), builds it in the
container — from the `PKGBUILD` in your repository if you named one, else a
PKGBUILD **drafted** from the project (with your agent key your agent
writes it and corrects it from the build log, up to three times; without a
key a template covers Rust, Go, CMake, Meson, autotools and release
binaries) — and uploads the package, the PKGBUILD, `PKGINFO` and the build
log to `staging/<you>/<package>/<task>/`. The task is then **staged**: the
Review page lists it, the log and the PKGBUILD are public, the package is
for maintainers. Nothing you build reaches users: a maintainer reads it
on the [Review](../../../../review) page and has the
project build it again — the project's agent, a worker the project
trusts, its own recipe written with your PKGBUILD, log, gate and audit as
the lesson — then approves *that* build into `edge` as source `factory`,
signed by the pool. Your build was the evidence, the project's build is
the product. A rejection comes with a note you see on your Contribute
page.

What a build can and cannot do, learned from the first contributor's day
(2026-09-15): a failed build is **not retried** — the next fresh container
would fail the same way — so fix the PKGBUILD and press *Build* again (the
pool retries only what the infrastructure broke: a download, a mirror, a
container killed under the build). A dependency that is itself a factory
package (pinta needs dotnet) is available to your build only once *that*
package was approved and published into `edge`; until then pacman says
*target not found*. A project with no release or tag is not built — the
factory packages releases (a `-git` package has nothing to pin). A split
PKGBUILD (`pkgname=(a b c)`) builds; only the base's `depends`,
`makedepends` and `checkdepends` are installed, as `makepkg --syncdeps`
would.

Limits: 10 tasks queued or building and 5 GB of staging per contributor
(a single PUT and a multipart upload honour the same cap). The pool gives
the space back itself: the packages of a build it is done with —
superseded by a newer one, rejected, failed for good, published — are
reclaimed at once, the recipe and the log stay; everything expires after
30 days. Drop a build early with `DELETE /api/v1/factory/tasks/<id>/artifacts`
(refused while queued or leased, or while the project builds from it; a staged
build is cancelled). *Remove* on your page takes the registration and
every build of the name — queued, running, or staged and waiting for a
maintainer — with the audits and trials queued for them: the packages
leave staging, what a finished build had put on the record (the recipe,
the log, the reports) stays, a build still running is cut off and leaves
nothing, and anyone can register the name again. Your worker fails a task at claim time when your
workspace is full, and reports an upload the pool refused as the build's
failure — the reason is on the build's page. A worker token is revocable
(`DELETE /factory/workers/<id>`); registering again replaces your contributor
token. `cosign verify ghcr.io/firemanxbr/omarchy-worker:latest
--certificate-identity-regexp github.com/firemanxbr/omarchy-pool
--certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` checks
the image is the project's.

Who approves, and how one becomes a maintainer, is
[Governance](https://omarchy-pool.firemanxbr.org/docs/governance): a file in this repository,
`factory/MAINTAINERS.toml`, changed by pull requests other maintainers review.

## Sizing a package before committing to it

A **dry run** builds and measures but never publishes or renders: a
maintainer queues it with `publish:false` —
`curl -X POST $API/factory/enqueue -H "authorization: Bearer omc_…" -d '{"name":"chromium","pkgbuild_ref":"<commit>","version":"…","arches":["aarch64"],"reason":"sizing","publish":false,"override":true}'`
(`override` when an upstream source ships the name). The worker keeps the
result under its work directory; the Pipeline's build tasks show it with a
*dry run* pill and how long it took. `factory/sizing/` holds recipes kept
only for this (chromium, from Arch Linux ARM): the only recipes left in
the repository, and the `enqueue` job never queues them.

## Run a worker

Anything with `podman` or `docker` and `curl` is a project worker: a
laptop, a VM, a Droplet. **Every task builds in a fresh Arch container**
(`archlinux:base-devel` for x86_64, `menci/archlinuxarm:base-devel` for
aarch64) that sees the PKGBUILD and the network and nothing else; the worker
process on the host holds only its own token, publishes the result and the
pool signs it — no key ever sits on a worker. A host builds its own
architecture natively and the other one emulated (`--arch`).

The easiest way is the same container image every worker runs,
`ghcr.io/firemanxbr/omarchy-worker` (both architectures, signed, tagged with
the pool's release; `factory/image/Containerfile`): given a token whose
registration a maintainer trusted, it runs `pkg-repo work` and starts each
build as a sibling container through the runtime's socket — the dashboard's
*Run a worker* page has the exact commands for Docker Desktop and Podman.
Without a container, the release binaries do the same:

```bash
# once: the pool's publisher (from the releases, or cargo build --release -p pkg-repo)
export OMARCHY_API=https://pkgs.firemanxbr.org OMARCHY_POOL=https://pool.firemanxbr.org

# register (POST /factory/workers with your contributor token) and have a
# maintainer trust it; then, native architecture:
pkg-repo work --worker-token omw_… --labels '{"where":"laptop"}'
# the other one, emulated (Apple silicon builds x86_64 through podman machine)
pkg-repo work --worker-token omw_… --arch x86_64 --labels '{"where":"laptop","emulated":true}'
```

`--idle-exit 300` makes a worker exit after five minutes without work;
`--once` makes it one-shot; SIGTERM (`docker stop`) drains it — the task in
hand runs to its end and is reported, nothing new is claimed, exit 0 — so
a container can be replaced without losing work. A build container gets `[omarchy-packages-edge]`
and `[omarchy-factory-edge]` in its `pacman.conf` — each one when the pool
serves that database for the architecture — so a package can depend on the
OPR or on an earlier factory build. `OMARCHY_PKG_CACHE=/path` on the host shares one
pacman package cache (a directory per architecture) with every build
container it starts, so a dependency downloads once; `OMARCHY_BUILD_CACHE`
likewise mounts a build cache at `/build/cache` — cargo's registry, Go's
module and build caches, ccache's objects — so a Rust or Go package
rebuilds in minutes. A build container uses every core it sees
(`MAKEFLAGS`, `NINJAFLAGS`, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`) with ccache on.

**Three roles.** The project runs its workers as three kinds of container
of that same image, `OMARCHY_WORKER_ROLE` set (`factory/image/entrypoint.sh`;
the dashboard's *Run a worker* page, *The three roles*): **pool** — a
project-trusted registration that takes only the pool's jobs (sync, render,
promote, rollback, health, security, enqueue, gc, verify); **review** — a
project-trusted registration that takes only the maintainers' work — the
project's own build of a reviewed package, the build of the recipes on
`main` and the audit of staged builds — reaching the agent through
`agent-proxy`; **community** — a community registration, shared, that builds
anyone's registered packages and drafts PKGBUILDs for package requests, as a
**broker** (the token, the agent key, `GITHUB_TOKEN`; runs no build) beside
a **builder** born with nothing; **broker** itself is a role
(`OMARCHY_WORKER_ROLE=broker`, `agent` without a worker token). A role
narrows what the trust allows and the container refuses a registration that
does not match; project trust takes two maintainers' word. Two of each,
one per architecture, plus the brokers, run on the project's own host
(`factory/host/`, RUNBOOK *The Studio host*).

**Whose compute.** Contributors build on their own workers (or a shared
community worker someone else runs); project builds — the ones written
from contributors' evidence — run on machines the project trusts. No GitHub runner ever builds a package: the project's compute is
not for building everyone's software, and GitHub Actions runs CI and the
release only — no worker, not even for the pool's own jobs: when the
project's host is down they wait, and the Workers page says so.

## The contract

The factory touches the pool through four things, all versioned in the API:

| The factory uses | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/package/:name` | who ships a name already (the guard) |
| `POST /api/v1/factory/{requests,enqueue}` · `/requests/:id/{approve,reject}` · `/tasks/:id/cancel` (a maintainer's token, or the enqueue job's) · `/tasks/:id/{build,approve,reject}` (a maintainer, never the owner) · `/{contributors,packages}/:x/{block,unblock}` (a maintainer; lifting by another) · `POST /factory/jobs` (a maintainer queues a pool job) · `GET /factory/built`, `/factory/maintainers`, `/factory/review`, `/factory/blocks` | maintainers and the enqueue job |
| `POST /api/v1/factory/claim` (a registered worker's token) · `/tasks/:id/{heartbeat,complete,fail}` (the claim's job token) | the worker protocol |
| `POST /api/v1/factory/register` · `/factory/packages[/:name/build]` · `/factory/workers` (contributor token) · `PUT /factory/tasks/:id/artifacts/:file` (worker token) · `GET /factory/packages`, `/factory/me` | contributors: registry, own workers, staging uploads |
| `pkg-repo publish --source factory --ring edge --arch …` · `pkg-repo render` | how a result enters the pool: as a source like any other |

Nothing in the pool knows how a package is built, where a worker runs or what a
PKGBUILD looks like; nothing in the factory knows how rings, rendering or
promotion work. Moving the factory to its own repository means moving
`factory/`, the `worker-image` jobs of `release.yml` and the issue form, and
pointing the repository name in the worker script, `reconcile.rs`,
`governance.ts` and `requests.ts` at the new home; the pool keeps
`worker/src/routes/factory.ts` (the queue) and the `factory` source.

### Worker protocol

```
POST /factory/claim                 {arch, hostname?, labels?, version?, kinds?, shared?, log?}   Authorization: Bearer omw_… (the registration)
                                    shared: the first word only — once the mode was set from the brain the registration's mode counts:
                                    POST /factory/workers/self/mode {mode} with this token, or POST /factory/workers/:id/mode with a
                                    contributor token (the owner; a maintainer may set dedicated, never shared — sharing is the owner's word);
                                    log: the worker's own lines since its last claim (4 KB a chunk, the last 8 KB kept), for its owner and
                                    the maintainers: GET /factory/workers/:id/log with a contributor token or the dashboard's session
  200 {task:{id,name,arch,version,pkgbuild_ref,reason,attempts,…}, token: "omj.…", token_expires_at, lease_minutes, repo, pkgbuild_path, upload}
  204 nothing queued for this worker
  426 {error, latest, yours, behind, update}   `version` (the image's release) is behind the pool's past the grace — every
                                               worker follows the latest image: update it and claim again (the worker sleeps 5 min)
POST /factory/tasks/:id/heartbeat                                 (the job token) → lease extended 30 min, a fresh token
POST /factory/tasks/:id/complete    {sha256, filename, version?, duration_ms?, log_tail?} · jobs: {result, summary}
  409 unless the sha256 is in the pool (project) or in staging (community)
POST /factory/tasks/:id/fail        {error, duration_ms?, log_tail?}
  → {status:"queued"} while attempts < max_attempts, else {status:"failed"}
PUT  /factory/tasks/:id/artifacts/:name                           (the job token) the evidence and the packages, one body up to 90 MB
POST /factory/tasks/:id/artifacts/:name/multipart?action=create · part&part=N&upload_id= · complete · abort
                                                                   a package above 90 MB, in 64 MB parts — the edge refuses a single body
                                                                   above 100 MB before the pool sees it; both workers upload this way,
                                                                   the project's review build included (bitwarden, 144 MB, 2026-09-17)
```

A claim is one `UPDATE … WHERE id = (SELECT … LIMIT 1) RETURNING *`; D1
serialises writes, so two workers never receive the same task. Only the lease
owner can heartbeat, complete or fail it (409 otherwise). The scheduler's cron
requeues leases past `lease_expires_at` — the way out for a worker that
vanished, not the way a worker reports: the community worker's shell has
last words, and whatever ends it while it holds a task (a command that fails
outside the build's subshell, under `set -e`) is posted to `/fail` at once
with the command and its status, the build's log with it. One job at a
time on a ring: a promotion into it, a rollback, a render and the security
fast-track (any ring) are not handed out while another of them holds a
lease on the same ring — a promotion into rc and a fast-track into rc ran
in the same minute and the fast-track's late rollback undid the promotion
(2026-09-17). Syncs and the read-only checks are not held.

  README.md                       this file
  worker/omarchy-build-worker.sh  the build half: `--inside` (called by pkg-repo work in a fresh container),
                                  `--container` (the contributor's one-task-per-container mode)
  MAINTAINERS.toml                the governance file: the maintainers, one list (docs/GOVERNANCE.md)
  bin/check-governance            validates it and generates .github/CODEOWNERS from it
  image/Containerfile             the one worker image (Arch, both architectures, signed, built by the release workflow); image/entrypoint.sh
                                  reads the registration and runs the contributor's or the project's half, or the updater; image/compose.yml
                                  runs the set — broker, builder, updater (or a project worker) — as `omarchy-worker start` writes it
  bin/omarchy-rollout             the updater: the compose set follows the pool's latest image, what changed replaced together, itself last
  bin/pkgbuild-meta               PKGBUILD → arches and version, without executing it as you
  sizing/<name>/                  recipes kept for dry runs only (never queued) — the only recipes in the repository
  bin/agent.py                    the owner's agent, whichever provider: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, xAI (by the key set)
  bin/draft-pkgbuild              project URL → PKGBUILD (the agent, or a template), checksums left to updpkgsums
  prompts/pkgbuild.md             the packaging rules the drafter follows
  bin/audit-pkgbuild              the second agent: staged PKGBUILD + log + .PKGINFO → audit.json / audit.md
  prompts/audit.md                what the auditor looks for, and the report's shape
.github/CODEOWNERS                      every maintainer owns the governance file and the sizing recipes
```
