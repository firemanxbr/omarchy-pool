# Runbook

Operating the staging environment. Nothing here is done by hand on the servers:
every write goes through the Worker with a per-job token a worker got at claim
time; there is no shared secret. Humans operate the pipeline by queueing jobs
(`pkg-repo job`, or the API with a maintainer's token) that project workers run.

## Trust model

* **Packages are never re-signed.** The sync imports a package only if its
  upstream `.sig` verifies against the upstream project's keyring
  (`archlinux.gpg`, `archlinuxarm.gpg`, `omarchy.gpg` — built by
  `tests/fetch-keyrings.sh`). A machine using the pool verifies packages with the
  keys it already trusts (`archlinux-keyring`, `archlinuxarm-keyring`, Omarchy's).
* **The pool signs with its own key, inside the Worker.** Databases are signed
  as they are stored (`PUT /releases/:id/artifacts/db|files`); a package the
  factory built is signed on request (`POST /pool/:sha256/sign`) against the
  bytes actually stored. Trusting the pool means trusting one key for
  `omarchy-*-<ring>.db` and `factory` packages; nothing else. No worker,
  runner or repository holds the key (SECURITY.md).
* **The pool is append-only.** The worker refuses to overwrite an existing object;
  the only deletions are retention (`gc`), which never touches anything the last
  three releases of any ring reference, nor anything younger than seven days.
* **Releases are append-only.** Rollback creates a new release pointing at an old
  selection; history is never rewritten. Every action posts an event.
* **Nobody holds R2 credentials, and nobody holds a pool credential.** Reads
  are public objects; writes go through the Worker with the per-job token of
  a task a project worker claimed; the R2 bucket has no API tokens.

## Everyday operations

Everything the scheduler does can be queued by hand by a maintainer
(`OMARCHY_API` and `OMARCHY_TOKEN=omc_…` set — the token from the Contributors
page); a project worker runs it with a per-job token and the Factory page
follows it:

```bash
pkg-repo job sync --param arch=x86_64                                  # every source of the architecture, one release per ring
pkg-repo job sync --param source=packages --param arch=x86_64 --param ring=rc   # one source
pkg-repo job promote --param from=edge --param to=rc --param note="…"
pkg-repo job promote --param from=rc --param to=stable --param note="…"        # evidence-gated: two green checks of rc in a row (--param soak_checks=1 for one)
pkg-repo job promote --param from=rc --param to=stable --param force=yes       # emergency: skips the gate (the target's health still rolls back)
pkg-repo job promote --param from=rc --param to=stable --param arch=aarch64    # one architecture only: its evidence, its gate, its rows; x86_64 keeps what stable serves
pkg-repo job rollback --param ring=stable --param to=<release id>              # then renders both architectures (or the overview's roll back button)
pkg-repo job rollback --param ring=stable --param to=<release id> --param arch=x86_64   # that architecture only
pkg-repo job render --param ring=stable --param arch=x86_64                     # any ring, the lab included
pkg-repo job health --param ring=stable --param arch=aarch64
pkg-repo job security
pkg-repo job enqueue                                                   # the PKGBUILDs on main → the queue, now
pkg-repo job verify                                                    # every served OPR object verified and repaired (--param ring= --param arch= --param repair=no to only report)
pkg-repo job trial --param task=<staged build>                         # the project's build into the lab and a real pacman on it, again
pkg-repo job gc --param keep=3
pkg-repo job relayout                                                  # one-time: every object into its source's directory (below)
```

Promotions are gated by evidence (see *Promotion by evidence* in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)): the job first records fresh `health` and
`abi` events for the source ring on both architectures, then the gate
decides — promote, nothing to promote, or blocked with the reasons in a `gate`
event on the dashboard. After a promotion the target ring is health-checked on
both architectures and rolled back automatically if that fails (`rollback` event
naming the failed and the restored release). There is no human in the daily
path: the evidence is the reviewer, and a maintainer who disagrees rolls back.

```bash
# the same decisions by hand
pkg-repo fast-track --ring stable --from edge --dry-run        # security fixes edge has and stable lacks (exit 3: none)
pkg-repo gate --from rc --to stable --soak-checks 2 --dry-run   # exit 0 promote, 3 nothing new, 1 blocked
pkg-repo head --ring stable                                    # current release id (rollback target)
pkg-repo diff --ring stable                                    # what the head changed against its parent (+ − ↑)
pkg-repo diff --ring rc --from 41 --to 45 --arch aarch64 --json  # any two releases inside retention
pkg-repo releases --all --json                                 # every ring's history, for scripts and agents
tests/abi-gate.sh rc x86_64                                    # ABI check of rc's upgrades, exit 2 on blockers
```

The reads run directly from anywhere (`pkg-repo releases --ring stable`,
`pkg-repo diff`, `pkg-repo head`, `pkg-repo gc --keep 3` without `--delete`
is a report); the writes above are jobs. A signed-in maintainer also rolls a
ring back from the Journal's *Ring history* (the *roll back* button on any
earlier row queues the same `rollback` job), and every row's *diff* link,
like the *diff* on a promotion or rollback line of the journal, opens
`/diff?ring=&from=&to=` — added, removed and upgraded packages, per
architecture (`GET /api/v1/releases/:ring/diff`). Both releases must still
be inside retention: GC prunes the membership of older ones (410).

## Releasing the pool itself

`main` is protected: no direct pushes, every change is a pull request that CI and
E2E must pass, squash-merged with the pull request title as the commit message.
Every merge is a release — there is no separate "cut a version" step:

1. `release.yml` runs CI and E2E again on the merged commit.
2. The next version is the last tag plus one **patch** (`v0.0.1 → v0.0.2`). Label
   the pull request `release:minor` for a significant change (`v0.1.0`) or
   `release:major` for an incompatible one; `workflow_dispatch` with `bump=` does
   the same by hand. Crate and `package.json` versions stay at `0.0.0` — the tag is
   the source of truth and is compiled into the binaries as `POOL_VERSION`.
3. Binaries (`pkg-repo`, `omarchy-cli`, `pkg-extract`) are built on x86_64 and
   aarch64 runners and attached to a GitHub release with notes generated from the
   merged pull requests.
4. The worker is migrated (`wrangler d1 migrations apply`) and deployed with
   `POOL_VERSION`, `POOL_COMMIT` and `POOL_DEPLOYED_AT`; the run verifies
   `/api/v1/version` reports the new tag and records a `deploy` event through
   `wrangler d1 execute` (the release holds no credential of the pool's API).

The deploy step needs the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` repository secret (Account →
Workers Scripts: Edit, D1: Edit, Account Settings: Read; Zone → Workers Routes:
Edit, Zone: Read, for `firemanxbr.org`). Without it the release is still
published and the run ends with a warning instead of a deployment.

Rolling the worker back is deploying an earlier release: re-run the Deploy job of
that release's run, or `git checkout vX.Y.Z && cd worker && npx wrangler deploy
--var POOL_VERSION:vX.Y.Z`. Migrations are forward-only; keep them additive.

## Security data

The `security` job (every 3 h, pulled by a project worker; `pkg-repo job
security` queues one by hand) fetches the Arch and Debian trackers, KEV and EPSS,
matches them (`pkg-repo security`) and then fast-tracks fixes into `rc` and
`stable` (`pkg-repo fast-track`, `--min-severity medium`, exploited-in-the-wild
always), renders, checks health on both architectures and rolls back a ring
that fails. Both commands are safe to run by hand with `--dry-run`. A wrong match is a
tracker's mistake or a name collision: open an issue with the package and the
advisory id shown on the package page; the `same_project` heuristic in
`crates/pkg-repo/src/security.rs` is where collisions are rejected.

## The pool's own scheduler

GitHub's cron is best-effort (on 2026-09-12 it delayed the hourly sync by an
hour and never started the half-hourly metrics), so the pool has its own
clock: a Cloudflare cron trigger on the Worker (`src/scheduler.ts`, every
ten minutes). Intervals for sync (3 h) and security (3 h), the PKGBUILD
reconcile (`enqueue`, hourly); promote by evidence (edge→rc queued by the
sync, rc→stable every 3 h), daily slots for health (08:30) and the Sunday GC — each queued as a
pulled job (below) when due and never doubled while one is queued or
running. The metrics snapshot (30 min), the governance sync (10 min), the
update check (05:45) and the cost estimate (every three hours) it does itself. One thing still starts on GitHub, by
dispatch: `factory-update.yml` (05:45, pull requests for the project's own
recipes). Each dispatch is a `dispatch` line in the journal and needs the
worker secret `GITHUB_TOKEN` (fine-grained, this repository, *Actions: read
and write*):

```bash
cd worker && npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN < ~/.cache/omarchy-cli-poc/github-token
```

Without the secret the jobs still run; only that dispatch stops.

## Pulled jobs (the pool without GitHub)

The pool's own work — sync, promote, rollback, render, health, security,
enqueue, gc — runs as tasks in the factory's queue when `JOB_KINDS` (a
Worker var, comma-separated kinds) lists the kind: the cron creates them
on schedule, a maintainer queues one by hand, and a **project worker**
pulls and runs them:

```bash
# on any machine with podman/docker, python3, curl, git (the health and ABI
# scripts) — a droplet, a laptop, a Hetzner box
pkg-repo work --worker-token omw_… --labels '{"where":"droplet-1"}'
```

The worker is registered like any other (`POST /factory/workers`) and a
maintainer promotes it: `POST /factory/workers/<id>/trust {"trust":"project"}`
with a maintainer's contributor token; maintainers are named by
`factory/MAINTAINERS.toml` (docs/GOVERNANCE.md), nowhere else. Every task
runs with a per-job token the pool issues at claim time (SECURITY.md);
the worker's own token only claims. No pipeline step runs on GitHub any
more: the workflows that did are gone, and a run by hand is a job. GitHub
Actions runs CI and the release only — there is no hosted worker: when
pool jobs wait and no project worker is alive, they wait, the scheduler
log and the Factory page say so, and *The Studio host* (below) is where
to look. Worker secret: `JOB_TOKEN_SECRET` (any random string) signs the
job tokens.

## The Studio host

The project's workers run on one machine — `omarchy-studio`, a Mac Studio
on Arch Linux ARM (Asahi), 12 cores, 32 GB, on around the clock — as six
containers of the worker image, two of each role, one per architecture
([factory/host/](../factory/host/README.md); the roles:
[factory/README.md](../factory/README.md) *Three roles*):

| Service | Registration | Takes |
|---|---|---|
| `pool-x86_64`, `pool-aarch64` | project trust | the pool's jobs: sync, render, promote, rollback, health, security, enqueue, gc, verify, relayout, trial |
| `review-x86_64`, `review-aarch64` | project trust, an agent key | the build of the recipes on `main`, the audit of staged builds |
| `community-x86_64`, `community-aarch64` | community, shared, an agent key | contributors' requested packages, with the project's agent |
| `broker-community-{x86_64,aarch64}` | `etc/agent.env` + the builder's token | the broker (`factory/bin/broker`): the worker token, the agent key and `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the builder beside it, which holds nothing; the pool's calls for the one task it claimed, the agent, GitHub read-only |
| `agent-proxy` | `etc/agent.env` — no worker token | the agent and GitHub, natively, over HTTP for the review workers' audits and their build containers (the `review` network): Claude Code's binary dies under qemu, so the emulated worker asks this one (`FACTORY_PROVIDER=anthropic`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://agent-proxy:8790`; `factory/bin/agent-proxy`) |

The host is aarch64: pool and review workers run natively (an x86_64 pool
job is a label). x86_64 *builds* would run under user-mode emulation,
and on this host's 16K-page kernel (Asahi) qemu cannot map every x86_64
library — `rustc` and `sudo` fail with *failed to map segment* — so the
two x86_64 build services sit behind the compose `emulated` profile, off
by default: x86_64 build tasks wait for an x86_64 worker, and any x86_64
machine with docker becomes one in minutes (factory/host/README.md,
*x86_64 builds*) — the pool does not care where a worker runs. Everything lives under `/srv/omarchy-pool`
(a btrfs subvolume on the internal disk; the 4 TB drive joins when it has a
USB enclosure — the Asahi kernel has no Thunderbolt tunnelling, so the NVMe
slot of a Thunderbolt dock is invisible to it): `work/<service>` (the same
path inside the project workers), `cache/pacman/<arch>` (one package cache
per architecture, mounted into every build container: `OMARCHY_PKG_CACHE`),
`cache/build/project/<arch>` and `cache/build/community/<arch>` (cargo, Go
and ccache caches the build containers mount at `/build/cache`:
`OMARCHY_BUILD_CACHE` for the project's, the compose file's volume for the
community's — a stranger's build never writes what the project's build
reads; inside, one directory per package),
`etc/` (the six worker tokens and `agent.env`, mode 600, never in the
repository). Day to day, on the host:

```bash
cd /srv/omarchy-pool
docker compose ps                                # six up?
docker compose logs -f --tail 50 pool-aarch64    # one of them
./rollout.sh                                     # a rolling upgrade to the latest image (a user timer runs it every 15 min)
```

Upgrades are **rolling**: a pool release publishes a new image, the timer
notices within fifteen minutes, and `rollout.sh` replaces the six one at a
time — a stop is a drain (SIGTERM: the worker finishes the task it holds,
reports it, claims nothing new and exits; the compose file allows three
hours), then the new container starts while the other five keep working.
No task is killed and none is handed to another worker by an expired
lease, which is what `docker compose up -d` on a busy worker did.

The Factory page shows them by role; the laptop runs nothing any more,
and GitHub Actions runs CI and the release only — there is no hosted
fallback worker: when the host is down, pool jobs wait, and the dashboard
says so.

## Maintainers: reviewing contributed builds

The **Review** page lists staged builds (a contributor's package built on
their worker or a shared one, with PKGBUILD, log, the gate's verdict and
the audit — and the worker and host behind it). A maintainer — a login
listed in `factory/MAINTAINERS.toml`, signed in with GitHub — never
decides on their own package, and never on a contributor's bytes:

- **Build by the project** queues a project build (`pkgbuild_ref =
  review:<task>`, trust `project`): a review worker (`pkg-repo work`)
  starts a fresh container that holds nothing, where the project's agent
  writes its own recipe with the request's facts and the contributor's
  evidence as the lesson, builds it through the same gate and stages it
  under `staging/@project/`; a second agent audits it, and the trial
  installs it with a real pacman from the lab.
- **Approve** the project's build (a contributor's cannot be approved)
  records the decision (`approvals`, with your login and note) and queues a
  `publish` job that carries it into `edge` as source `factory` — and, when
  the trial passed, into rc and stable with it (the fast lane). The pool
  signs; from there the package follows the rings like any other.
- **Reject** needs a note; the package returns to *registered* with the
  note in its detail, the staged objects expire with the rest.
- **Withdraw a record** (`POST /api/v1/factory/record/withdraw {key,
  reason}`) when a log or a report must leave the public bucket: a signed
  tombstone takes its place, the staging copy goes with it.

**Sign in with GitHub** (the header's *Sign in*) is the GitHub OAuth App
`omarchy-pool` (registered under the GitHub account that runs the staging
deployment, *Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps*; it moves with the
project, MIGRATION part C;
callback `https://omarchy-pool.firemanxbr.org/auth/github/callback`,
homepage the dashboard, no device flow, expiring user tokens on — the
token is used once, to read the login). Its client id is
`GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `wrangler.toml`; the secret is set with
`npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` and rotated from the
app's page (*Generate a new client secret*, set, then delete the old one).
The logo is `docs/omarchy-pool-logo.png`.
The session is an HttpOnly cookie on the dashboard's origin; the pages call
the API same-origin. Without the app, the Factory page still accepts a
GitHub token used once.

Roles come from the repository, not from an API: `factory/MAINTAINERS.toml`
lists the maintainers (one list, no areas), the brain reads `main` every
ten minutes (`worker/src/governance.ts`) and sets each contributor's role
from it — every change a `role` line in the journal. Changing the file
is a pull request another maintainer approves (`.github/CODEOWNERS` is
generated from it by `factory/bin/check-governance --write`; CI checks they
agree). See [Governance](https://omarchy-pool.firemanxbr.org/docs/governance). `GET /api/v1/factory/maintainers`
and `/factory/approvals` are the public record. What a package is about is
its *category*, proposed by the project's agent at audit and settled by a
maintainer (`POST /factory/packages/<name>/category`).

## Adding a repository

The pool mirrors a fixed table of upstream repositories; a new one from the
same project (an `omarchy-t2` beside `omarchy`, say) is a new **source**:

1. `worker/src/scheduler.ts`, `SYNC_SOURCES`: one entry per architecture and
   ring it serves — `source`, `arch`, `ring`, `base_url` (the upstream
   directory with the `.db`), `db_name` (the upstream database's name),
   `keyring` (which of `tests/fetch-keyrings.sh`'s keyrings verifies it).
2. `worker/src/routes/packages.ts`, `SOURCES`: the name, so the index accepts
   manifests with that provenance.
3. A keyring, if the packages are signed by a key none of the existing
   keyrings holds: `tests/fetch-keyrings.sh`.

The rest follows the source name: the rendered repository is
`omarchy-<source>-<ring>` (`render`), its objects and databases live in
`<source>/<arch>/` on the pool, the health check reads the rendered
databases from the release's artifacts, the coverage table and the pipeline
status list every source they see. The next sync imports it; the next
promotion carries it. Its place in the include is `REPO_ORDER`
(`worker/src/meta.ts`): a ring keeps every source's build of a name, and
that order is what decides between them on a machine.

## The relayout (one directory per source)

Until 2026-09-15 the pool was flat: `<arch>/<filename>`, one object per
filename whichever source built it — so Arch's `asusctl-6.5.0-1` stood in for
the OPR's, Arch Linux ARM's `libkrunfw` for Asahi's, and a ring could hold
one build of a name. Now every source has its directory
(`<source>/<arch>/<filename>`, `worker/src/r2.ts`) and a ring holds one
row per source, name and architecture (routes/releases.ts). The move is
the `relayout` job, run once:

```
pkg-repo job relayout
```

It copies every object into its source's directory (R2 checks the row's
sha256 on the way; the signature and attestation travel with it; nothing
is deleted), renders every ring so the databases sit in the same
directories, then purges what is left under the flat `x86_64/` and
`aarch64/`. 34 k objects, 311 GB, an hour or three; ~US$ 0.40 of R2
operations. While it runs, the include names both directories for every
section — pacman tries the servers in order, so a package not yet moved is
still found — and drops the flat one when the last object has moved. A row
whose bytes the pool never held (a rebuild indexed behind an earlier build
of the filename, before 2026-09-12) is marked `ghost/…` and left to
retention. The `relayout` event in the journal says what moved, what was
a ghost, what could not be copied.

Every machine set up before it needs the new include once — the one
command, again:

```
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.firemanxbr.org/setup | sudo bash -s -- --ring stable
```

Its old include keeps working until the purge; after, its `Server =
…/$arch` lines name a directory that is gone.

## When what the pool serves does not verify

The pool holds one object per `<source>/<arch>/<filename>` and never
overwrites it; the OPR rebuilds the same version per channel with different
bytes. Before
the pool refused a signature for bytes it does not serve (2026-09-12), two
things went wrong and pacman then refused the package as *corrupted*: a
later channel's `.sig` beside an earlier channel's object (69 of stable's 229
OPR objects on 2026-09-13), and a second index row for the same filename
pinned by a ring while the object stayed the first build's (5 more). The
`verify` job (weekly, Saturday 03:00 UTC; `pkg-repo job verify` by hand)
downloads every OPR object a ring serves, checks the bytes against the
index and the signature against Omarchy's key, and repairs: the right
`.sig` from the upstream channel that still serves those bytes; the ring
re-pinned to the object the pool holds (indexed from the bytes when the
index never saw them), then rendered. What no channel serves any more is
listed in the `verify` event for a replacement. The health check downloads
a sample per repository (eight from the OPR) so a wrong signature is
evidence the day it appears; the sync pins the stored object whenever a
filename collides, known sha or not; GC never deletes an object another
index row still names.

The first run (task 98, 2026-09-14) repaired the 69 signatures and then
failed on its own re-pin: `packages not indexed`. An `any` package is one
object per architecture directory with different bytes (Arch Linux ARM
rebuilds them), and the job remembered what the pool stores by filename
alone — so a ring's x86_64 re-pin carried the aarch64 bytes. It now keeps
one entry per `<arch>/<filename>` of the OPR's directory, and a re-pin happens exactly when the
ring's pin differs from what that directory stores, whatever the
signature's story was. The index holds one row per sha256 (0001_init.sql):
the same bytes stored under both directories can be indexed for one of
them, and the other directory's pin is reported rather than forced
(`POST /packages` answers 409, not a database error). The second attempt
re-pinned the 5 objects (rc#18, stable#8) and every OPR object verified.

## The factory

What no upstream ships is built from `factory/pkgbuilds` by workers that pull
tasks from the pool ([factory/README.md](../factory/README.md)). Day to day:

- **Add a package**: sign in and request it on `/request` (the project's
  URL, a description, the licence, the checklist — written once to the
  public record), press *Build*, and a maintainer reviews the staged build
  (docs/GOVERNANCE.md). Without a worker of your own, a *shared* community
  worker whose owner runs an agent takes the drafted build
  (`draft:<url>@latest`); the request shows on the Factory page until then.
  The project's own recipes live flat in `factory/pkgbuilds/<name>/`: a
  pull request a maintainer reviews; the merge queues the build (the hourly
  `enqueue` job, or `pkg-repo job enqueue` right away).
- **Rebuild**: `curl -X POST $API/factory/enqueue` with a maintainer's token
  (`{"name","pkgbuild_ref":"<commit>","version","arches"}`;
  `override` builds even a name upstream ships), or approve a staged build
  again on the Review page.
- **A failed task**: the Factory page shows the error and the log tail
  (`GET /api/v1/factory/tasks/:id` has the full tail). Fix the PKGBUILD in a
  pull request; merging queues it again.
- **Workers**: contributors' builds run on their workers; project builds
  (approvals, `factory/pkgbuilds`) on project-trusted workers — today the
  Mac (`pkg-repo work`, one process per architecture). No GitHub runner
  builds packages; a queued build waits for a project worker. Workers
  hold no key: the pool signs what they publish.
- **The Omarchy reference for the ABI gate**: `tests/omarchy-rootfs.sh
  x86_64 stable` installs the ISO's package set from `stable` into a
  container and keeps pacman's database and the libraries under the
  worker's work directory (`omarchy-rootfs/x86_64`, ~1.5 GB) for seven
  days; the gate rebuilds it when older. The packages are installed as
  bytes (`SigLevel = DatabaseRequired PackageNever`): what a reference
  needs is their libraries; whether their signatures verify is the health
  check's and the verify job's question. A missing or failed reference
  never blocks the gate — the `abi` event says *omarchy: unavailable* and the
  base image alone decides.
- **OPR provenance**: once a day (05:15 UTC) the brain reads
  `omacom/omarchy-pkgs` — one tree request, then one request per package
  whose PKGBUILD changed — and records whether each OPR recipe is Omarchy's
  own or synced from the AUR (`.omarchy/package.json`), the AUR commit it
  tracks and the last commit that touched it. The package page says which;
  the Status page's coverage section counts the AUR-synced recipes `stable`
  still serves — the number to drive to zero. `provenance` lines in the
  journal record each scan that changed something.
- **OSV**: the security job also asks OSV about what the served packages
  embed (Go modules, cargo-auditable crates — `GET /api/v1/security/components`;
  only packages indexed since the extractor learned to read build information
  carry them). Records are cached under the worker's `osv/` directory;
  `pkg-repo security --osv-cache DIR` by hand, omit the flag to skip OSV.
- **The audit** (the second agent, GOVERNANCE.md): every staged community
  build queues an `audit` task. A project worker takes it only when it
  was started with an agent key in its environment — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `XAI_API_KEY`, or a Claude
  subscription as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (Claude Code in print mode, no
  tools; the worker installs it at start) (`pkg-repo work` adds
  the `audit` kind by itself then; `FACTORY_PROVIDER` picks among several
  keys, `FACTORY_MODEL` the model — defaults `claude-sonnet-5`, `gpt-5`,
  `gemini-3.6-flash`, `grok-4`; `FACTORY_REASONING=low` keeps a reasoning
  model's answers inside the budget — the Studio sets it, and a reply cut
  short is retried once with four times the budget). The Factory page's
  *Agent* column shows what
  each worker reported. The report lands next to the evidence
  (`/api/v1/factory/tasks/<id>/artifacts/audit.md`) and the Review page
  shows the verdict; *waiting* in that column means no such worker is
  running. It is advice for the maintainer; nothing acts on it. A build
  approved or rejected before the audit ran cancels it.
- **New upstream versions** — two paths, one rule (evidence before review):
  - a package a contributor registered: once a day (05:45 UTC) the brain
    asks GitHub for each approved package's latest release and queues a
    community build from the approved PKGBUILD with `pkgver` moved to the
    tag (`bump:<task>@<tag>`, `updpkgsums` in the worker). The owner's
    worker has **14 days**; then a worker a maintainer shares (`--shared`)
    may build it. (A contributor's request is different: it lands in the
    shared queue at once — any shared worker, the best idle one first for
    three minutes, the owner's own at any time — and a build asked for one
    worker — `worker` in `POST /factory/packages/<name>/build`, `pinned_to`
    on the task — waits for that worker only; revoking the worker frees it;
    the owner takes a queued build out with
    `DELETE /factory/packages/<name>/builds/<id>`.) A
    maintainer reviews the staged build like the first one. **30 days**
    without a build and the package is *unmaintained* (Factory page badge,
    `bump` journal line): no more bumps until its owner builds again, or a
    maintainer removes the registration (`DELETE /factory/packages/<name>`)
    so someone else can take it;
  - a recipe in `factory/pkgbuilds/<name>/`: `factory-update.yml` (daily,
    05:45 UTC from the scheduler) bumps `pkgver`, refreshes checksums and
    opens one pull request per package for a maintainer to review — never auto-merged; the merge queues the build. It relies on the
    repository setting *Actions may create pull requests*. Packages without
    a GitHub `url=` (vi) are bumped by hand.
- **Contributors' builds** land in the `omarchy-factory-staging` bucket
  (`staging/<login>/<package>/<task>/`, lifecycle rule: 30 days), listed on
  the Factory page with their PKGBUILD and log; the packages themselves are
  readable by maintainers (`GET /api/v1/factory/tasks/:id/artifacts/<file>`).
  Quotas per contributor: 10 tasks queued or building, 5 GB staged; a
  single PUT and a multipart upload honour the same cap. The pool gives
  the space back on its own (`worker/src/staging.ts`): the packages of a
  build it is done with — superseded, rejected, failed for good, published,
  cancelled — go at that moment, their PKGBUILD, log, gate and audit stay
  (and are on the record); the weekly `gc` job drops everything past 30
  days, rows and objects together, so the quota never counts what the
  bucket's lifecycle rule already deleted. A contributor drops a build
  early with `DELETE /factory/tasks/<id>/artifacts` (refused while queued
  or leased, or while the project builds from it; a staged build is
  cancelled). A worker whose owner is at the quota fails the task at claim
  time, with the reason, instead of building into a 413; an upload the pool
  refuses is reported as the build's failure, the pool's answer as the
  reason. A contributor token (`omc_…`) or worker token (`omw_…`) is a random secret
  hashed in D1; revoke a worker with `DELETE /factory/workers/<id>` as its
  owner, or set `revoked_at` in `build_workers` by hand.
- **Tokens**: there is no shared worker secret. Every worker — each of the
  Studio's six, a droplet's, a contributor's — is a registration with its
  own `omw_` token; project trust is a maintainer's decision on that
  registration. The Studio's tokens live in `/srv/omarchy-pool/etc/*.env`
  on the host (`factory/host/register.sh` writes them); to rotate one,
  revoke the worker, blank its env file, run `register.sh` again,
  `docker compose up -d`.

## Costs

The account's card is capped at **US$ 30 a month**. What costs money on
Workers Paid is usage over the included quotas — above all D1 rows read
(25 B/month included, then US$ 0.001 per million) and rows written
(50 M/month included, then **US$ 1.00 per million**), then R2 storage
(US$ 0.015/GB after 10 GB; egress is free). The review of 2026-09-13 found
the overview re-scanning `release_packages` on every call (US$ 14 a day)
and every release copying its whole selection three times (index included).
What keeps the bill near US$ 10:

- a release's summary is computed once and stored (`releases.package_count`,
  `bytes`, `sources`); the pool-wide aggregates that need the join are
  computed by the metrics snapshot every 30 minutes, not per request;
- a release is a **delta** (migration 0017): what a ring serves lives in
  `ring_packages`, a release writes only what it added and removed, and the
  full membership is written out only for a checkpoint — the first release
  of a ring, then every 24th, and any older release read by id. A sync that
  moves a hundred packages writes a hundred rows, not thirty thousand; GC
  drops the checkpoints and deltas nothing inside retention starts from.
  The delta is computed in SQL with the request's lists materialised once
  (CTEs): evaluated per row over a 32k-row ring, the first version took
  D1 past its CPU limit and every sync failed for three hours on
  2026-09-13 (the release row and its delta are one transaction since, so
  a failed attempt leaves nothing behind); a release on a 32k-row ring
  takes about 50 ms of D1 time now;
- the sync runs **every three hours, one task per architecture, one release
  per ring** — not one release per source per hour. With releases this
  cheap the interval could go back to hourly (`scheduler.ts` RULES); what
  an hourly sync still costs is the rows it reads to diff against upstream.

**Watching it.** Every three hours the brain estimates the month's bill
from Cloudflare's own analytics — what was used so far, priced, plus the
*current* rate (the last day, scaled) for the days left, so a fix shows in
the next estimate instead of being averaged with the expensive days before
it (`src/cost.ts`; secret `CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`, an API token with
*Account Analytics: Read* and *D1: Read*). The latest estimate is
`settings.cost_latest` — `GET /api/v1/cost` has the breakdown and the
Pipeline page shows the projection — and one `cost` journal line a day
(the first estimate after 06:00 UTC) keeps the history. `cost-report.yml`
(06:45 UTC) posts it as a comment on the *Cost report* issue — GitHub
e-mails it to whoever watches the issue — and fails the run at a projected
US$ 25, which is one more e-mail. Cloudflare's own budget notifications
e-mail at actual charges of US$ 10, 20 and 28 (*Notifications → Billing →
Usage based billing*; the API token cannot create them).

**What the rows cost.** `wrangler d1 insights omarchy-repo --time-period 1d
--sort-by reads --limit 40` lists the queries by rows read — the one
measurement that matters, since D1 bills rows read (25 billion a month
included, then US$ 0.001 per million). On 2026-09-16 the pool read 414
million rows a day; the three biggest were the service status sorting every
rendered artifact to find the newest (an index now), the stats page
grouping every event ever recorded to find the latest per kind (a table
kept by a trigger now, `latest_events`), and the half-hourly snapshot
recounting the whole pool when nothing had changed (it reuses the previous
one now). The jobs' own reads were the next two, and they scale with how often the
gates run — promotion is attempted after every sync and every three hours
now: the ABI gate's dependency closure (`/api/v1/graph`) read the ring's
providers for every edge, 20–45 million rows a call, because the planner
probed `package_provides` through an automatic index on `declared`; the
plan is pinned (`CROSS JOIN … INDEXED BY`) and a call reads the ring once
plus the edges. A page of a release's manifests (what a render and a
health check page through, 500 at a time) started from the release's
members — all of them, sorted, per page, 73k rows for 500; it walks the
`(name, repo_arch, source)` index from the cursor now and asks per row
whether the package is in the release. And the ABI verdict of an
unchanged release stands for a day: an attempt three hours later does not
repeat it (`gate::abi_evidence_stands`); the health check, which is the
soak, runs every time. `test/graph.test.ts` measures both queries' rows
read, so a planner regression fails CI.

**Who uses it.** Once a day (00:30 UTC) the brain counts yesterday's
audience from the same analytics: the distinct client addresses that
fetched a ring database (`/<source>/<arch>/omarchy-*-<ring>.db`) on the pool's host,
per ring and per architecture, as one `audience` journal line
(`src/audience.ts`); the Pool page's community card and the Pipeline's
counters show it, `/api/v1/stats` carries the last 30 days. Nothing is kept
per request — one number per day. An address is a machine most of the
time (a NAT hides several, a laptop on the move counts twice), so the
dashboard says *about*. It needs `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` (wrangler.toml) and
the analytics token to also carry *Zone · Analytics · Read* on the zone;
without it the day is skipped and the scheduler log says so once a day.

**The guard.** Three lines (`src/cost.ts`): the report warns at a
projected US$ 25; at a projected or actual **US$ 40** the brain sets
`settings.cost_guard` and the scheduler stops creating the jobs that write
(sync, promote, render, security, enqueue) until an estimate — the next is
at most three hours away — is back under the line; **US$ 50** is the
month's cap, agreed with the sponsor, never to be raised. Health, gc and
metrics keep running, the pool keeps serving. The header of every page says so. To lift it by hand:
`npx wrangler d1 execute omarchy-repo --remote --command "DELETE FROM settings WHERE key = 'cost_guard'"`.

## Known limits

* **D1 under a bulk import.** Importing a whole repository (thousands of
  manifests with file lists) makes the index the bottleneck: reads can hit
  D1's per-query CPU limit ("exceeded its CPU time limit and was reset") and
  `wrangler d1 migrations apply` in a release can fail on it — re-run the job.
  pacman is never affected (packages and databases are static objects on R2);
  the dashboard shows the index as *degraded* on its status pill. GET responses
  of the API are cached at the edge for their `max-age` (30 s for stats, 60 s
  for search and package pages, 120 s for security), so viewers do not multiply
  the load; the pages poll every 60–120 s and retry transient errors.

## Kill switch

```bash
cd worker && npx wrangler secret put JOB_TOKEN_SECRET   # a new value: every job token in flight stops working
# then set JOB_KINDS = "" in wrangler.toml and deploy: the scheduler queues nothing
```

Reads keep working (static objects); workers find no work and their tokens
buy nothing. Revoke a single worker with `DELETE /factory/workers/<id>`.

## Reset (ephemeral by design)

Everything is reproducible from `main` plus the secrets; a full rebuild from the
mirrors takes a few hours.

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler d1 execute omarchy-repo --remote --command "DELETE FROM release_artifacts; DELETE FROM ring_heads; DELETE FROM release_packages; DELETE FROM releases; DELETE FROM package_files; DELETE FROM package_requires; DELETE FROM package_provides; DELETE FROM package_file_lists; DELETE FROM packages; DELETE FROM events; DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence;"
# optionally empty the bucket (objects are re-uploaded by the next sync, or kept and re-indexed)
pkg-repo job sync --param arch=x86_64 && pkg-repo job sync --param arch=aarch64
```

## Rotate the signing key

The private key lives only in the Worker secret `SIGNING_KEY` (armored
OpenPGP; `SIGNING_KEY_PASSPHRASE` when it has one). Generate it on a
trusted machine, pipe it straight into the secret and keep no copy:

```bash
export GNUPGHOME=~/.cache/omarchy-cli-poc/gnupg
gpg --batch --quiet --passphrase '' --quick-generate-key "Omarchy Staging Signing <staging@firemanxbr.org>" ed25519 sign 1y
KEY=$(gpg --list-keys --with-colons staging@firemanxbr.org | awk -F: '/^fpr/{print $10; exit}')   # newest
gpg --armor --export "$KEY" > docs/omarchy-staging.pub.asc
cd worker
gpg --batch --armor --export-secret-keys "$KEY" | npx wrangler secret put SIGNING_KEY
npx wrangler r2 object put omarchy-packages/omarchy-staging.pub.asc --file ../docs/omarchy-staging.pub.asc --remote
cd .. && gpg --batch --yes --delete-secret-keys "$KEY"   # the Worker is the only holder
curl -s https://pkgs.firemanxbr.org/api/v1/signing-key | jq .fingerprint   # the new key
for ring in edge rc stable; do for arch in x86_64 aarch64; do pkg-repo render --ring $ring --arch $arch; done; done
```

Clients must import the new public key (`pacman-key --add … && --lsign-key`).
Packages the factory built under the old key keep their signatures — those
verify against the old public key until each package is rebuilt (a
`POST /pool/:sha256/sign` per stored object re-signs them with the new one).

## Add a source or an architecture

A source is one row of `SYNC_SOURCES` in `worker/src/scheduler.ts`: source
name, arch, **ring** (`edge` — every source enters there and promotion
carries it forward; no source is synced straight into `rc` or `stable`), the directory
holding the `.db`, the db name, the keyring `tests/fetch-keyrings.sh`
produces, and the sources it defers to (`chaotic` defers to
`core,extra,multilib,packages,factory`: a name one of them serves is never
imported from chaotic-aur). Add the same source to `EXPECTED_SOURCES` in
`worker/src/meta.ts` (with `optional: true` for a repo users opt into on
*Get started*) and to the sources table on *How it works*. If it is a new
upstream project, add its keyring to `tests/fetch-keyrings.sh`. A new
architecture also needs an image in `tests/images.env`, a worker of that
architecture and the arch lists in `scheduler.ts` (`jobsOf`) and
`jobs.ts`.
