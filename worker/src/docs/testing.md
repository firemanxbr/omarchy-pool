# Testing

Everything runs on a developer machine without root and without touching
production. Real Arch packages are used as fixtures wherever the behaviour depends
on the archive format.

## Quick check

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs exactly these on x86_64 **and** arm64 runners,
plus the worker typecheck and its tests, on every pull request. The three end-to-end scripts
below also run in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) on native x86_64
runners, where the Arch container needs no emulation. Both are required checks on
`main`, and `release.yml` runs them once more on the merged commit before it tags a
version and deploys the worker — so what is running is always a commit that passed
them twice.

## Rust crates

| Crate | What is covered | How |
|---|---|---|
| `pkg-manifest` | dependency rule parsing, `vercmp` against pacman's own test table, manifest JSON round-trip | unit tests |
| `pkg-extract` | `.PKGINFO` parsing, ELF magic detection, soname → Arch provide conversion, symbol version collapsing, Go build information (the `modinfo` string, replacements, the inline version header) | unit tests |
| `pkg-extract` | end-to-end manifests from **real** `zlib` and `xz` packages (`tests/fixtures/`) | `tests/fixtures.rs` |
| `pkg-repo` | `desc`/`files` rendering identical to `repo-add`, database determinism | unit + `tests/database.rs` |
| `omarchy-cli` | the MCP server's protocol handling: initialize, notifications, ping, tools/list, unknown methods, tool errors as results (`isError`) not protocol errors, bad arguments refused before any request | unit tests |
| `pkg-check` | pacman `desc` parsing, satisfiers, ABI check verdicts against a real `liblzma.so.5` | unit + `tests/check.rs` |
| `pkg-store` (`poc/crates`) | install / upgrade / remove, collisions, `.pacnew`, I/O failure rollback, crash recovery before and after commit | `tests/transactions.rs` against a temp root |

Useful invocations:

```bash
cargo test -p pkg-extract                 # one crate
cargo test -p pkg-store -- --nocapture    # see tracing output
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test -p pkg-store    # more detail
```

### Fixtures

`crates/pkg-extract/tests/fixtures/` holds unmodified packages downloaded from the
Arch `core` mirror. To refresh one:

```bash
curl -sSLO "https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/core/os/x86_64/<file>.pkg.tar.zst"
```

Keep fixtures small (< 1 MB). Behavioural tests that need specific file layouts
build **synthetic** archives at runtime with `poc/crates/pkg-store/tests/common/mod.rs`
(`make_pkg`), so no new fixture is needed for a new scenario.

### Manual inspection

```bash
cargo run -p pkg-extract -- inspect crates/pkg-extract/tests/fixtures/xz-5.8.4-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
cargo run -p pkg-extract -- index crates/pkg-extract/tests/fixtures -o /tmp/index.json
```

## Worker

```bash
cd worker && npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test                   # vitest inside workerd: unit and integration tests, about a second
npm run db:migrate:local   # applies migrations to a local D1
npm run dev                # http://localhost:8787 with local D1 + R2
```

`npm test` runs every file in `worker/test/` **inside the Workers runtime**
(`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, `vitest.config.ts`): a local D1 with every
migration applied before each file (`test/setup.ts`), a local R2, the
bindings of `wrangler.toml` plus a test `JOB_TOKEN_SECRET`. Nothing reaches
the network. Two kinds of tests live there:

| File | What is covered |
|---|---|
| `releases.test.ts` | the release logic through the Worker's own `fetch`: manifests indexed into the pool, `POST /releases` — first release, adds on top of the head, replace-by-name within a source and architecture (another source's build of the name stays; `remove_from` drops one source's, `remove` every source's), `remove` / `remove_arch`, promote `edge → rc → stable` by copying the source head, rollback to an earlier release (lineage, history, `is_head`), the scopes each ring needs; the diff between releases; `unchanged_arches`; `GET /releases/:ring` paged in `(name, arch, source)` order (keyset cursor with the source, the older two-part cursor still accepted) with `release_id` pinning, `arch=`, `include=files`; `GET /graph?arch=` (declared dependencies and provides, per architecture); `GET /stats` before any metrics snapshot; the delta model — a release writes only its delta, checkpoints every 24th, an old release read by id is reconstructed, retention keeps the checkpoint a rollback inside it needs and prunes the rest (410 beyond); the lab — any object pinned into it, never promoted from or into (400), its include the lab's sections above edge's |
| `relayout.test.ts` | the one-time move to one directory per source (`routes/relayout.ts`): objects copied with their signature and attestation and R2 checking the row's sha256, rows pointed at `<source>/<arch>/<filename>`, a null key backfilled, a row whose bytes the pool never held marked `ghost/…`, purge refused while anything is left to move and then emptying the flat directories; the upload, index, signature and `/packages/known` routes speaking the new layout — a filename is one object per source, another source's build of it another object |
| `factory.test.ts` | the factory's brain (the trial included: queued for the project's build only, on its architecture, a community worker never takes it, its token reads the staged package and writes the lab and nothing promised, `trial.log` beside the evidence, the verdict on the Review row); claims with worker tokens (own architecture only, project vs community), leases and per-job tokens, heartbeat, fail → requeue, complete after the package is indexed, the agent a worker reports; a community build staging its evidence (the builder cannot write `audit.*`, the package is for maintainers, the rest is public), the audit queued and taken only by a project worker declaring the kind, the report attached and its verdict on `/factory/review`; approvals — a contributor cannot, a maintainer cannot approve their own package while another maintainer exists, the rebuild queued at project trust, the record and the profile's track record; what a public log must not carry (a token, a key or the worker's environment in text evidence is a 422 with the kind and the line, never the match; the record never receives it; the log's tail and the error line withheld at complete/fail; multipart closed for text evidence); who trusts whom (a proposal, the second word, never the owner's, the signed record, back at one word); the worker behind every staged build on Review; a record withdrawn with its signature and staging copy, the tombstone's fields |
| `leak.test.ts` | the shapes a public log must not carry (`src/leak.ts`): each kind, the first hit's line, and the ordinary things a log says that are not one |
| `pages.test.ts` | the dashboard's pages through the Worker's fetch handler: every door and detail page served, the three doors in the navigation, the footer badge, the Pool's headline, the Factory's forms, the Pipeline's live hooks, the docs' five stages, no template placeholder left behind, the old chapter addresses still redirecting |
| `audience.test.ts` | one day of the zone's request analytics becomes one number per ring and per architecture; recorded once as an `audience` event; a token without *Zone · Analytics · Read* is reported once for the day, then quiet |
| `provenance.test.ts` | the OPR provenance scan against a stubbed GitHub: origin per package from the tree and `.omarchy/package.json`, only changed packages fetched again, packages gone from the repository dropped, the per-ring counts |
| `jobtoken`, `scheduler`, `governance`, `updates`, `metrics`, `cost`, `signing` | the pure functions: tokens and scopes, the scheduler's rules, the governance file, bump detection, the metrics snapshot shape, the bill estimate, OpenPGP signing |

The end-to-end script below covers the same paths with real containers and
real pacman; the unit tests are what a pull request runs in seconds.

Keep `worker/src/manifest.schema.json` in sync with the Rust types:

```bash
cd worker && npm run schema:sync && git diff --exit-code src/manifest.schema.json
```

## End-to-end: pacman against a generated database

Requires a container runtime (Podman or Docker) and `gpg`. The script indexes the
fixture packages, renders and signs the `omarchy` database with a throwaway key
(created on first run in `~/.cache/omarchy-cli-poc/gnupg`), signs the packages the
way a mirror or build would, and runs a real pacman (`archlinux:base`, x86_64) inside
a container with `SigLevel = Required DatabaseRequired` against a `file://` mirror:

```bash
tests/e2e-pacman.sh
```

It exercises `-Sy` (signed database accepted), `-Sl`, `-Si`, `-Sp`, the files
database (`-Fy`/`-Fl`), `-Sw` (download with signature verification) and a real
`-U` install. On Apple Silicon the x86_64 image runs under emulation; the first run
pulls the image.

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `podman: command not found` | install Podman Desktop (or Docker) and `podman machine start` |
| `agent_genkey failed: No agent running` | `GNUPGHOME` path too long for a Unix socket; keep the default cache location |

## End-to-end: the whole pipeline through the worker

Same requirements plus the worker's npm dependencies. Starts a throwaway local
worker (`wrangler dev` with local D1 and R2 under `target/e2e-worker/`), publishes
the fixtures to `edge`, promotes `edge → rc → stable`, renders and signs the
`stable` databases, checks the mirror routes (databases, signatures, blobs, Range),
and finally runs pacman in a container against
`http://host.containers.internal:<port>/stable/os/$arch`:

```bash
tests/e2e-worker.sh
```

This is the local proof for POC questions 1 and 2: pool objects are uploaded once
(re-publishing is a no-op), promotion is an index write measured in milliseconds,
and pacman consumes the generated database exactly as it would a `repo-add` one.

The run also verifies what the local pool serves: `pkg-repo verify` finds
the fixtures clean, then a signature of other bytes planted beside zlib —
found, and without an upstream channel serving those bytes, reported for a
replacement rather than kept.

The same run exercises the factory against seeded workers and contributors:
claims with worker and job tokens, a community build staged through the
job token and its evidence served, the audit it queues (a community worker
never gets it; the builder cannot write `audit.*`; a project worker declaring
the `audit` kind attaches the report with the audit's own token, and only
that; Review shows the verdict; the agent the worker reported at claim time
is listed on the Factory API), a shared worker waiting for `shared_after`,
the governance table and maintainers API, the profile page and API (with
the track record), the browser session (`/auth/me` with the
cookie, sign-out invalidating it on the server while the CLI token keeps
working), `workers/self`, and the approval rules (nobody approves their own
package; the bootstrap exception with a single maintainer).

Publisher commands used by the script, for manual runs against any worker:

```bash
export OMARCHY_API=http://127.0.0.1:8787 OMARCHY_TOKEN=<a job token>   # tests/e2e-worker.sh shows how one is minted from JOB_TOKEN_SECRET
pkg-repo publish --ring edge foo-1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst   # pool + index + new edge release
pkg-repo promote --from edge --to rc                        # --arch aarch64: that architecture only
pkg-repo render --ring rc                                   # databases for the ring head (the pool signs them)
pkg-repo releases --ring rc                                 # history, newest first (--json, --all)
pkg-repo diff --ring rc                                     # what the head changed: added, removed, upgraded
pkg-repo rollback --ring rc --to <release id>               # then render again (--arch x86_64: that architecture only)
```

## End-to-end: the thin client

Runs `omarchy-cli` against the staging index and two real Arch systems exported
from containers (only `var/lib/pacman/local` and `usr/lib/lib*.so*` are extracted):

```bash
tests/e2e-client.sh
```

* current `archlinux:base` → `check xz` is safe, `install --dry-run` prints the
  `pacman -U` command; three `.hook` files dropped into the rootfs show the
  hook preview: one triggered by the package's name, one by a file it ships
  (`usr/bin/xz`, fetched from the ring), one not (a `Remove` trigger); a typo
  in `--ring` is refused before any request;
* `archlinux:base-20210131` (glibc 2.32) → `check xz` is **BLOCKED** on
  `libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.34)` with exit code 2 and pacman is never invoked;
* with `cargo-zigbuild` installed (`brew install zig && cargo install cargo-zigbuild`)
  the client is cross-compiled for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `omarchy-cli upgrade`
  runs inside the container: safety check, `pacman -U` from the pool with signature
  verification, hooks, and the release pin.

The container needs `DisableSandboxSyscalls` in `/etc/pacman.conf` because pacman
7's seccomp download sandbox cannot run under x86_64 emulation; the script sets it.

You can also point the client at any rootfs by hand:

```bash
OMARCHY_API=https://pkgs.firemanxbr.org omarchy-cli --root target/rootfs-2021 check xz
```

## Benchmark (historical)

The proof-of-concept benchmarks — the index model at scale and today's rsync +
repo-add mechanics at the same package count — live in `poc/bench/`
(`bench-promotion.sh`, `bench-current.sh`, `seed.py`) with their results in
[`poc/RESULTS.md`](../poc/RESULTS.md); the `Benchmark` workflow runs them by hand.

## The images the checks run in

`tests/images.env` pins `archlinux:base` and `menci/archlinuxarm:base` by
digest; every script that starts a container sources it, so a run today and
a run next month see the same image. `tests/pin-images.sh` moves the pins
to the current digests (commit the diff).

## Health check

```bash
OMARCHY_API=… OMARCHY_POOL=… OMARCHY_TOKEN=… tests/health-check.sh stable
```

The include the check writes is the pool's own (`/api/v1/pacman.conf`), so
each section's `Server` is the directory its database is in; every project's
keyring the caller fetched (`OMARCHY_KEYRINGS`) is imported and trusted, the
way `pacman-key --populate` would.

## The trial

```bash
OMARCHY_API=… OMARCHY_POOL=… OMARCHY_TOKEN=… OMARCHY_KEYRINGS=… tests/trial.sh aarch64 <staged build> <package>…
```

What the `trial` job runs once the project's review build sits in the lab: a
clean container of the architecture with the include of `--ring lab` — the
lab's sections above `edge`'s — checks each named package would come from a
lab section, installs them for real (`pacman -S`, dependencies from `edge`,
hooks run), verifies their files (`pacman -Qkk`), and ends with a `TRIAL=`
line (`ok`, `sync-failed`, `not-from-lab`, `install-failed`, `files-differ`).
Posts a `trial` event either way and writes the transcript to
`$OMARCHY_WORK_DIR/tmp/trial-<build>.log`, which the job attaches to the build's
evidence as `trial.log`.

Second argument selects the architecture (`x86_64` default, `aarch64` uses the Arch
Linux ARM image on an ARM host). Reads the ring's rendered repos from
`/api/v1/stats`, writes a `pacman.conf` with
`SigLevel = Required DatabaseRequired`, runs `pacman -Sy`, lists every repo and
downloads the first package with signature verification inside an Arch container,
then posts a `health` event (ok / warn when nothing is rendered / error). The
`health` job runs it daily for every ring and architecture; the `promote` job
runs it for the source ring before the gate and for the target ring after the
promotion — on the project worker, with the job's token (`OMARCHY_TOKEN`).

## ABI gate

`tests/abi-gate.sh <ring> [arch]` checks two references: the distribution's
base image and, on x86_64, the Omarchy installation `tests/omarchy-rootfs.sh`
builds from `stable` (cached a week under `OMARCHY_WORK_DIR`); the `abi`
event carries one entry per reference (`references`), blockers in either
block. Run by hand:

```bash
OMARCHY_API=… OMARCHY_POOL=… OMARCHY_TOKEN=… OMARCHY_KEYRINGS=… OMARCHY_WORK_DIR=… tests/abi-gate.sh rc x86_64
```

### The check itself

```bash
OMARCHY_API=… OMARCHY_POOL=… OMARCHY_TOKEN=… tests/abi-gate.sh rc x86_64
```

Exports the pacman database and shared libraries of the official base image
(`archlinux:base`, `menci/archlinuxarm:base` for aarch64), asks
`omarchy-cli status --json` which installed packages the ring would upgrade, and
runs `omarchy-cli check` on them in batches of 40 (each batch resolves its
dependency closure through `/api/v1/graph?arch=`). Posts an `abi` event with the
counts and the first blockers; exits 2 on any blocker, 1 if a batch could not be
checked. Runs in a few seconds; the `promote` job runs it for both architectures.

## Security matching

OSV: `cargo test -p pkg-repo osv` covers the matcher (a hit becomes an exact
advisory against every Arch package that embeds the component, one per
package; severities from the database's word, else a coarse reading of the
CVSS v3/v4 vector; Go versions lose their `v`); `cargo test -p pkg-repo osv --
--ignored` asks the real API about an old `golang.org/x/crypto` and caches
the record. The worker test indexes a manifest with components and checks
`GET /security/components` lists them once a ring serves the package.

### Trackers

```bash
curl -sfL https://security.archlinux.org/issues/all.json -o arch.json
curl -sfL https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/json -o debian.json
curl -sfL https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json -o kev.json
curl -sfL https://epss.cyentia.com/epss_scores-current.csv.gz | gunzip -c > epss.csv
pkg-repo security --arch-tracker arch.json --debian debian.json --kev kev.json --epss epss.csv --dry-run
```

The dry run prints the vulnerable matches by source and confidence and samples of
the Debian `name-version` matches (ours vs Debian's fixed version) to eyeball the
heuristics; without `--dry-run` it writes to the index and posts a `security`
event. The decisions are unit-tested in `crates/pkg-repo/src/security.rs`
(`cargo test -p pkg-repo security`): version comparison against Arch advisories,
Debian filling only what Arch does not cover, the upstream-version extraction
and the name-collision rejection. `tests/e2e-worker.sh` puts an advisory on the
zlib fixture and checks the ring report and the KEV flag.

```bash
pkg-repo fast-track --ring stable --from edge --dry-run     # candidates only; exit 3 when none
omarchy-cli --ring stable --root <rootfs> security          # installed packages with open advisories
omarchy-cli --ring stable --root <rootfs> upgrade --security-only --dry-run
```

The candidate rule (confident match, medium or worse or exploited in the wild,
a clean newer version in the source ring) is unit-tested with the rest of the
security module.

## The broker, and the worker script's secrets

`python3 tests/broker.py` (CI) runs `factory/bin/broker` against a fake
pool and a fake agent: the worker's token added to the pool's calls and a
user agent of its own (Cloudflare answers urllib's default with 403), the
job token stripped from claim and heartbeat, one task at a time (a second
claim 409, another task's id 403), a restarted broker adopting the task the
pool says is leased to its worker, `complete` releasing the hold, the agent
cap per task, who really answered (`agent`) for the probe, GitHub read-only
with the token, and the pool path off without a worker token.
`python3 tests/agent-claude-code.py` runs the claude-code provider against
a fake `claude`.

What the build sees is checked by hand in the worker image (SECURITY.md,
*Isolation*): `hold_secrets` leaves a child with no secret, `as_builder`
gives the build user seven variables and no read of `/proc/1/environ`,
`with_secrets` lends the agent its keys with nothing in an argv; a builder
started with `OMARCHY_BROKER` drops a token set on it by mistake and starts
the build with zero secrets. `factory/worker/omarchy-build-worker.sh` is
sourced up to its dispatch line for that (`sed '/^hold_secrets$/,$d'`), in
`docker run --rm ghcr.io/firemanxbr/omarchy-worker:aarch64` with fake values.

## The agent without a key

`factory/bin/agent.py` honours `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`,
`GEMINI_BASE_URL` and `XAI_BASE_URL`, so a stub that answers
`POST /v1/messages` (Anthropic) and `POST …/chat/completions` (the
OpenAI-compatible path Gemini and xAI share) with a fixed report exercises
every provider path of `audit-pkgbuild` — parsing, the verdict check, the
Markdown rendering — without a key; `pkg-repo work
--kind audit --once` against a local pool with the same variables runs the
whole executor (fetch the staged evidence, attach `audit.json` / `audit.md`,
complete with the verdict).

## Promotion gate

`pkg-repo gate --from <ring> --to <ring> [--soak-days N] [--dry-run]` reads the
`health` and `abi` events and decides (exit 0 promote, 3 nothing to promote, 1
blocked, reasons printed and recorded as a `gate` event unless `--dry-run`). The
decision is a pure function with unit tests in `crates/pkg-repo/src/gate.rs`:
fresh green evidence promotes; a failed latest health, a failure inside the soak
window, stale or missing evidence, recent ABI blockers, or a security
regression (a package the target serves clean that the source would replace
with a version under an open exact advisory of medium severity or worse, or
in KEV — `security::security_regressions`, from `GET /security?ring=<from>`)
block; `warn` (nothing rendered for an architecture) is ignored; a target that
already serves the source's head is a skip. `cargo test -p pkg-repo gate` and
`cargo test -p pkg-repo regression` run them.

## Cloudflare (staging)

The staging worker runs at `https://pkgs.firemanxbr.org` (index API + dashboard at
`https://omarchy-pool.firemanxbr.org`) with a real D1 database and an R2 bucket
whose custom domain `https://pool.firemanxbr.org` serves packages and databases
statically. Deploying is what a merge into `main` does (`release.yml`, see
[RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#releasing-the-pool-itself)); by hand, for a hotfix or a
rollback to an earlier tag:

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply omarchy-repo --remote
npx wrangler deploy --var POOL_VERSION:vX.Y.Z --var POOL_COMMIT:$(git rev-parse HEAD) --var POOL_DEPLOYED_AT:$(date -u +%FT%TZ)
```

To try dashboard or API changes against the real data without deploying,
`npx wrangler dev --remote --port 8799` runs the local code with the remote D1
and R2 bindings (reads only, unless you publish to it).

Writing to the production pool is what jobs do, with the per-job token a
worker gets at claim time; there is no shared secret to export. A maintainer
runs any of them by hand by queueing the job (`pkg-repo job`, or
`POST /api/v1/factory/jobs` with their contributor token):

```bash
export OMARCHY_API=https://pkgs.firemanxbr.org OMARCHY_TOKEN=omc_…   # a maintainer's token
pkg-repo job sync --param source=core --param arch=x86_64             # import from mirror.omarchy.org → edge
pkg-repo job promote --param from=edge --param to=rc
pkg-repo job render --param ring=stable --param arch=x86_64           # one omarchy-<source>-stable db per source
pkg-repo job gc --param keep=3
```

The same commands run directly (`pkg-repo sync|publish|promote|render|gc`)
against a local pool with a job token (`tests/e2e-worker.sh` mints one).

With `--keyring <file>` the sync rejects any package whose upstream `.sig` does
not verify against that keyring; `tests/fetch-keyrings.sh <dir>` builds
`archlinux.gpg`, `archlinuxarm.gpg` and `omarchy.gpg`. Arch Linux ARM and the OPR
have their own layouts: `--base-url http://os.archlinuxarm.org/aarch64/core --arch aarch64`,
`--base-url https://pkgs.omarchy.org/edge/x86_64 --db-name omarchy --source packages`.

The scheduler queues exactly these as jobs (sync every 3 h, promote daily,
health daily, security every 3 h, gc weekly, enqueue hourly); project workers
run them. No GitHub workflow writes to the pool.

To validate with pacman, use the same container recipe as the local scripts with

```
[omarchy-core-stable]
Server = https://pool.firemanxbr.org/core/$arch
```

and the POC public key imported into `pacman-key`. This has been exercised end to end:
`-Sy` accepts the signed database, `-Sw` downloads the package and its signature from
the pool through the worker, and `-U` installs it.
