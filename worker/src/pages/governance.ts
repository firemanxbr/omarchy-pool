  <h1>Governance</h1>
  <p class="lede">Two roles, one file, decisions by pull request. Anyone who signs in with GitHub is a <b>contributor</b>. The people listed in <a href="${FILE}"><code>factory/MAINTAINERS.toml</code></a> are the <b>maintainers</b> — one list, no areas: every maintainer reviews everything. Nobody is above that — no owner, no superuser, no button that grants a role: the project belongs to its maintainers and contributors, and the pool reads the file on <code>main</code> every ten minutes and applies it.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>The maintainers</h2>
    <p class="sub">Read live from the pool, which read <code>factory/MAINTAINERS.toml</code> on <code>main</code> <span id="synced"></span>. This is a community pool: nothing in it is official Omarchy, and no package here is endorsed by the Omarchy project.</p>
    <div class="table-wrap"><table id="maintainers"><thead><tr><th>Maintainer</th><th>Since</th></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></div>
    <p class="sub" style="margin-top:14px"><b>Categories, not groups.</b> What a package is about — terminal, editors, browsers, media, system… — is its <em>category</em>: the project's agent proposes one from the evidence when it audits a staged build, a maintainer settles it at review and may change it any time. A category says where to look for a package; it never says who may approve it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Contributors and maintainers: we do not use what you built, we learn from it</h2>
    <p class="sub">A contributor uses exactly the tools a maintainer uses — the same signed worker image, the same PKGBUILD conventions, <code>namcap</code>, the same build — to produce a package that respects the packaging practices, is checked for quality and is safer for users; an AI agent may help, because nobody knows better than the author how their software should be compiled and packaged, and an agent turns that knowledge into a recipe faster. <b>What the contributor built is never what users get.</b> The maintainer does not trust it and must not: they redo the work on a worker the project trusts. What they have in front of them is not "some software, go package it" — it is a recipe that already built, its log, its manifest, its metrics, the corrections the agent made along the way. Evidence. It makes the maintainer faster and less likely to err, and the approval more confident, not less demanding.</p>
    <p class="sub">Zero trust between people, shared knowledge between them. Users get a package at least <b>two different people</b> checked — the contributor who made it work, the maintainer who rebuilt and attested it — and, when both sides run an agent, one that two independent agents built and tested.</p>
    <p class="sub"><b>The second agent.</b> The contributor's agent, if any, wrote the recipe; the maintainer's side has one too. When a build is staged the pool queues an <em>audit</em>, a job a project worker takes only if its owner set an agent key. It reads the same evidence the maintainer will — PKGBUILD, build log, <code>.PKGINFO</code> — and attaches a structured review (supply chain, security, packaging practice, correctness against the log, licence) to it. <a href="/review">Review</a> shows the verdict: <code>ok</code>, <code>warn</code>, <code>block</code>. Evidence, never a decision — nothing in the pool acts on it; the maintainer does.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>What each role does</h2>
    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step"><h3>Contributor</h3><p>Signs in with GitHub — nothing else is asked. Requests packages, runs workers on their own machines, follows their builds. A contributor's worker builds <em>their</em> packages; the result is evidence in their staging workspace, never a package users receive.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>Maintainer</h3><p>A contributor listed in the file. Reads a contributor's staged build with the evidence in front of them and either rejects it or has <b>the project build it again</b> — a worker the project trusts, the project's agent, its own recipe written with the contributor's PKGBUILD, log, gate and audit as the lesson, never as the product — then approves or rejects <em>the project's build</em>; the approval is what goes into the rings, signed. <b>Never their own package</b>: another maintainer approves what a maintainer brought, and a project with a single maintainer is no exception — that maintainer's own packages wait for a second one. Vouches for a worker as the project's — with a second maintainer, never the owner; settles each package's category; blocks a contributor or a package when the evidence says so, with the reason on the record; reviews governance pull requests.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>The project's workers</h3><p>Machines maintainers trust. They only do what a maintainer would: the pool's jobs (sync, promote, health, security, gc), the audit of staged builds and the build of the recipes on <code>main</code>. They never build from a contributor's staged artifact and never pull a new package that has no evidence and no review yet.</p></div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Becoming a maintainer</h2>
    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step"><h3>1. Contribute first</h3><p>Every maintainer was a contributor: packages registered, builds staged, reviews taken part in. Sign in, and the record of what you did is public on the <a href="/factory">Factory</a> page.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>2. A maintainer proposes you</h3><p>A maintainer opens a pull request adding your login to <code>factory/MAINTAINERS.toml</code>. The pull request says why; it is a decision people make, not a database write.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>3. Another maintainer approves</h3><p>The file is owned by all maintainers (<code>CODEOWNERS</code>) and <code>main</code> requires a code-owner review: at least one <em>other</em> maintainer approves, nothing is auto-merged. The merge is the promotion; within ten minutes the pool applies it and your next sign-in shows the role.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>Departures, the first maintainer</h3><p>A maintainer stepping down is the same pull request with the same review. While the project has a single maintainer there is nobody else to approve <em>the pull request that adds the second one</em>: that maintainer merges it alone and GitHub records the bypassed review — the one bootstrap exception, gone the moment the second maintainer exists. It never extends to packages: a sole maintainer's own packages wait.</p></div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Workers, compute and agents</h2>
    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step"><h3>One image, the registration decides</h3><p>Contributors and maintainers run the same container, <code>ghcr.io/firemanxbr/omarchy-worker</code>; what it does follows the trust a maintainer gave the registration behind its token — a contributor's builds inside the container, or the project's jobs, audits and builds of the recipes on <code>main</code> in fresh sibling containers. <a href="/docs/workers">Run a worker →</a></p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>Yours, and only yours</h3><p>A registered worker builds only its owner's packages. Donating compute to everyone's builds is a maintainer's call — the project's shared community workers are the ones maintainers run; a contributor's worker is never shared, whatever flag it starts with. And a worker is <em>ready</em> only when what its work needs answers: a build or an audit needs an agent that replies to the probe, not merely a key that is set.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>Agent keys stay with the worker's owner</h3><p>If a worker drafts or corrects PKGBUILDs with an agent (community trust), or audits staged builds for the maintainers (project trust), the key is its owner's, in the container's environment when it starts — <code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY</code>, <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code>, <code>GEMINI_API_KEY</code> or <code>XAI_API_KEY</code>, whichever provider they use; <code>FACTORY_MODEL</code> picks the model. The worker reports which agent it runs (<code>anthropic/claude-sonnet-5</code>, <code>openai/gpt-5</code>, …) for the Factory page; the key itself never travels. The pool holds no agent key and GitHub runs no agent — nothing of the pipeline runs there; what an agent produces is evidence like any other build, reviewed by a maintainer before it reaches anyone.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>Package requests</h3><p>A request (<a href="/request">the request page</a>: the project's URL, a description, the licence, the checklist — written once to the public record) becomes a task for a <em>shared</em> community worker whose owner runs an agent, or for the contributor's own worker. No such worker, no draft: the request waits, visibly, on the Factory page.</p></div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Blocking</h2>
    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step"><h3>A contributor</h3><p>Nothing more in: no request, no build, no worker — the pool answers with the reason. Their workers are revoked, their tasks cancelled, their packages pulled from every ring; their projects and sources stay closed to new accounts, so a fresh login does not open the door again. A maintainer cannot block themself or another maintainer: that is a pull request on <code>factory/MAINTAINERS.toml</code>.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>A package</h3><p>Out of every ring, its tasks cancelled, its registration rejected, its project URL refused until the block is lifted.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>Lifted by another maintainer</h3><p>Never the one who blocked — the same two-person rule as the approval. Lifting restores nothing: workers register again, packages are requested again, everything comes back through the gate and the review. Each block and each lift is a signed record in the public bucket with who, when and why; the <a href="/review">Review</a> page shows what is in force.</p></div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The record</h2>
    <p class="sub">Every role change is a <code>role</code> line in the <a href="/">journal</a>, every approval an <code>approvals</code> row a maintainer signed with their login, every trust decision a <code>trust</code> line, every block and its lifting a signed record in the public bucket. The file's history on GitHub is the history of who decided what.</p>
    <p class="sub"><b>Track record.</b> A profile sums that record — as a contributor: packages a maintainer let in, builds staged, bumps, builds done for others, rejections; as a maintainer: approvals, rejections, approvals whose project build then failed — into one number with a public, dull formula: <code>3·let in + staged + bumps + for others − 2·rejected + 2·approvals + rejections − 3·builds failed</code>. It says how much work was done here, and nothing else: no rank, no badge, no threshold.</p>
