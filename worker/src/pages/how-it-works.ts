  <h1>How it works</h1>
  <p class="lede">Packages come from the projects that build them, are verified, stored once, and served in rings that only move forward on evidence. Nothing is rebuilt or re-signed; what changes is <em>when</em> a package reaches you and <em>what was checked</em> before it did.</p>

  <div class="chart" style="padding:18px">${DIAGRAM}</div>

  <section>
    <h2>Where the packages come from</h2>
    <p class="sub">The pool mirrors the repositories below. Every package must carry a signature by a key in that project's keyring; unsigned or mismatching packages never enter.</p>
    <div class="table-wrap"><table><thead><tr><th>Source</th><th>Architecture</th><th>Repositories</th><th>Verified against</th></tr></thead><tbody>
      <tr><td>Arch Linux (via the Omarchy mirror)</td><td>x86_64</td><td><code>core</code> <code>extra</code> <code>multilib</code></td><td><code>archlinux-keyring</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Arch Linux ARM</td><td>aarch64</td><td><code>core</code> <code>extra</code> <code>alarm</code></td><td><code>archlinuxarm-keyring</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Omarchy Package Repository (OPR)</td><td>x86_64 · aarch64</td><td><code>omarchy</code> — the OPR's own <code>edge</code> / <code>rc</code> / <code>stable</code> channel goes into the matching ring</td><td>Omarchy's signing key</td></tr>
      <tr><td>chaotic-aur <span class="muted">(optional)</span></td><td>x86_64</td><td><code>chaotic-aur</code>: prebuilt AUR packages; only names no other source provides, so Arch and the OPR always win</td><td><code>chaotic-keyring</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>The factory</td><td>x86_64 · aarch64</td><td><code>factory</code>: what no source above ships — built from PKGBUILDs reviewed in the repository by ephemeral workers that pull tasks from the pool; today, the OPR names that exist only for x86_64, built for aarch64 (<a href="/factory">Factory</a>)</td><td>the pool's own key</td></tr>
    </tbody></table></div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What happens to a package</h2>
    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step"><h3>1. Sync</h3><p>Every hour the upstream database is read and compared with the index by sha256; only what is missing is downloaded. Each file is checked against the upstream checksum and signature, its <code>.PKGINFO</code>, dependencies, <code>provides</code>, file list and the sonames its binaries load are extracted, and the archive plus its <code>.sig</code> are stored in the pool under <code>&lt;arch&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</code>. A file is never stored twice and never modified.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>2. Pin</h3><p>The sync then creates a new <b>edge</b> release: an immutable list of exactly which objects the ring serves. Releases are append-only; every ring has a history you can point it back to.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>3. Promote on evidence</h3><p>Once a day a real pacman syncs the source ring in a container on x86_64 and on aarch64, and <code>omarchy-cli check</code> runs the ELF-level safety check on every upgrade the ring would apply to a reference system. A gate reads that evidence: the latest checks must be green, nothing may have failed inside the soak window and the content must have been there that long (one day for stable), a recent ABI check must have no blockers, and the security layer must report no regression — a package the next ring serves clean that this one would replace with a version under an open advisory. Only then is the selection copied to the next ring — an index write, no bytes move.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>4. Render and verify</h3><p>The ring's pacman databases (<code>omarchy-&lt;source&gt;-&lt;ring&gt;.db</code> and <code>.files</code>) are generated from the index, signed with the pool's database key and placed beside the packages. The target ring is health-checked again on both architectures; if that fails, the ring is pointed back at its previous release and re-rendered automatically.</p></div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security, with the graph</h2>
    <p class="sub">Every three hours the objects the rings serve are matched against the Arch Security Tracker (exact, Arch's own versions), the Debian Security Tracker (same upstream projects, for what Arch has not triaged yet — with a confidence level, never as a certainty), CISA KEV and EPSS. Because the index knows what every binary loads, an advisory on a library also marks what <em>uses</em> it: the <a href="/security">Security page</a> shows the ring, the package page shows the chain, the graph marks the nodes.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="factory">
    <h2>The factory: packages nobody ships yet</h2>
    <p class="sub">Three personas, three costs. <b>Users</b> only see the pool: signed databases, health checks, 48 hours from <code>edge</code> to <code>stable</code>, rollback. <b>Contributors</b> have something to package: they register it (a GitHub login and the project's URL — nobody to ask, nothing spent by the project), run the signed <code>omarchy-worker</code> container wherever they like, with their own agent keys, and the build lands in <em>their</em> staging workspace with the PKGBUILD and the log. <b>Maintainers</b> approve staged builds with the evidence in front of them — and never use the contributor's bytes: an approved package is rebuilt from the same recipe on a worker the project trusts, signed by the pool, and enters <code>edge</code> as source <code>factory</code> to take the same 48-hour path as everything else. <em>We do not use what you built, we learn from it</em>: the recipe, the log and the metrics a contributor produced with the same tools (and, if they like, their own agent) make the maintainer's own build faster and its approval surer, so every package users get was checked by two different people — and, when a project worker runs an agent, by a <b>second agent</b> that audits the staged evidence before the maintainer reads it. Nobody approves their own package. New upstream releases of an approved package are built again on the contributor's worker and reviewed again. Who the maintainers are, and how one becomes one, is a file in the repository changed by pull request — see <a href="/docs/governance">Governance</a>. Every stage is on the <a href="/factory">Factory</a> page.</p>

    <h2>Why one <code>Server =</code> is enough</h2>
    <p class="sub">Today an Omarchy machine talks to several repositories, each with its own mirror, cadence and failure modes. Here they are one set of databases per ring, generated from the same index, on both architectures.</p>
    <div class="howto">
      <div class="arch"><div class="archhead"><span class="archname">before</span></div><pre>[omarchy]

  <section>
    <h2>What you trust</h2>
    <p class="sub">Two things, and only two.</p>
    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step"><h3>The projects' own keys — unchanged</h3><p>Packages are the exact files Arch, Arch Linux ARM and Omarchy built and signed. pacman verifies each package with the keyring you already have (<code>archlinux-keyring</code>, <code>archlinuxarm-keyring</code>, Omarchy's key). The pool cannot alter a package without breaking its signature.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>The pool's database key — one import</h3><p>The pacman databases are generated here, so they are signed here — inside the pool's own service, by a key that never leaves it: no build worker, runner or repository holds it. That key signs the databases and the packages the factory builds, nothing else; its public part is in the repository, at the pool root and at <code>/api/v1/signing-key</code>, and with <code>SigLevel = Required DatabaseRequired</code> pacman refuses a database it did not sign.</p></div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The seal: where every package came from, with proof</h2>
    <p class="sub">A package from the AUR is a recipe someone maintains; a package from a distribution is a file its build farm signed. A package from the pool carries its <b>provenance</b> with it, and every package page shows it.</p>
    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step"><h3>Imported</h3><p>A synced package names its upstream project and repository, and the keyring its signature was verified against the moment it entered the pool — served as built and signed there, never rebuilt.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>Built by the Omarchy Pool</h3><p>A factory package carries the whole chain: the contributor's build that was the evidence (its worker, its agent, its log), the second agent's audit and verdict, the maintainer who approved it, the recipe a maintainer wrote and merged, the project's build of it on a trusted worker. The chain is also written <b>next to the object in the pool</b> as an attestation — an in-toto statement about that exact file — with the pool's detached signature beside it, so anyone can verify it with the pool's public key and never trust this page.</p></div>
      <div class="step"><h3>On your machine</h3><p><code>omarchy-cli info &lt;package&gt;</code> prints the seal; <code>omarchy-cli provenance</code> prints one line per package, and as a pacman hook (<code>docs/omarchy-pool.hook</code>) it says, after every install, where what you just installed came from. <code>pacman -Qi</code> shows it too: <code>Packager: omarchy-pool factory</code>, repository <code>omarchy-factory-&lt;ring&gt;</code>.</p></div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The pieces</h2>
    <p class="sub">All of it is open source (MIT), released on every merge, and shows its version in the header.</p>
    <div class="table-wrap"><table><thead><tr><th>Piece</th><th>What it is</th></tr></thead><tbody>

GitHub only releases the code (every merge).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Factory</td><td>The build queue lives in the index (requests, tasks, leases); workers are containers anywhere — a contributor's laptop for their own packages, machines the project trusts for what maintainers approved — that claim a task, build it in a fresh Arch container and report; the pool signs what a project worker publishes into <code>edge</code>. A lease that expires goes back to the queue.</td></tr>
