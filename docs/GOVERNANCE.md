# Governance

Two roles, one file, decisions by pull request.

- Anyone who signs in with GitHub is a **contributor**: requests packages,
  runs workers on their own machines, follows their builds. Nothing to ask,
  nothing spent by the project.
- The logins listed in [`factory/MAINTAINERS.toml`](../factory/MAINTAINERS.toml)
  are the **maintainers** — one list, no areas: every maintainer reviews
  everything. Nobody is above that — no owner, no superuser, no API that
  grants a role: the project belongs to its maintainers and contributors,
  and the pool reads the file on `main` every ten minutes and applies it
  (`worker/src/governance.ts`); every change is a `role` line in the
  journal.

This is a **community pool**. Nothing in it is official Omarchy, no
package here is endorsed by the Omarchy project, and the dashboard says
so wherever a package is shown.

## Contributors and maintainers

*We do not use what you built; we learn from it.*

A contributor uses exactly the tools a maintainer uses — the same signed
worker image, the same PKGBUILD conventions, `namcap`, the same build — to
produce a package that respects the packaging practices, is checked for
quality and is safer for users. An AI agent may help: nobody knows better
than the author how their software should be compiled and packaged, and an
agent turns that knowledge into a recipe faster. The agent's key is the
contributor's, on their machine; the project runs no agent for them.

**Nothing the contributor built is ever used — not the package, not the
recipe.** The maintainer does not trust it and must not. What they have in
front of them is not "some software, go package it" — it is a recipe that
already built, its log, its manifest, the gate's transcript, the second
agent's audit, the corrections made along the way. Evidence. A maintainer
(never the owner) reads it and has **the project build the package
again**: on a worker the project trusts, with the project's agent, which
gets the request and that evidence as the lesson and writes the project's
own recipe from the project's sources — through the same gate, staged
like any build, its evidence on the record. Then a maintainer approves
*the project's build*, and only that goes into the pool, signed. The pool
enforces the line: a contributor's build cannot be approved (the API says
so), a worker refuses to start from a staged artifact, and the project's
build carries `review:<task>` — where it learned, never what it copied.

Zero trust between people, shared knowledge between them. Users get a
package at least **two different people** stood behind — the contributor
who made it work, the maintainer who had it built again and attested it —
built twice, on two workers, by two agents, and never the first one.

### The second agent

The contributor's agent, if any, wrote the recipe. The maintainer's side
has one too: when a build is staged, the pool queues an **audit** — a job
a project worker takes only if its owner set an agent key. That worker
reads the same evidence the maintainer will (the PKGBUILD, the build log,
the `.PKGINFO`), asks its model for a structured review — supply chain,
security, packaging practice, correctness against the log, licence
(`factory/prompts/audit.md`) — and attaches `audit.json` and `audit.md` to
the evidence. The Review page shows the verdict next to the build: `ok`,
`warn` (approve with the findings in mind), `block` (do not approve as
is). It is evidence, never a decision: nothing in the pool acts on it, the
maintainer does. The builder cannot write those two files, and the audit
cannot write anything else; a build decided before the audit ran cancels
it. No project worker with a key, no audit: the column says *waiting*.

## Categories, not groups

There are no groups: no package belongs to an area whose maintainers own
it, and no maintainer reviews only a part of the pool. What a package *is
about* — for a person browsing — is its **category**, one of a fixed list
(`worker/src/categories.ts`): `terminal`, `editors`, `development`,
`browsers`, `communication`, `media`, `graphics`, `office`, `games`,
`system`, `networking`, `security`, `fonts`, `themes`, `libraries`,
`other`.

- **The project's agent proposes it.** When it audits a staged build it
  names a category in its report, from pkgdesc, the upstream project and
  what the package installs. The registration takes the proposal only
  while nobody settled one (a `category` line in the journal says so).
- **A maintainer settles it** — on the Review page, under the package
  name, or with `POST /api/v1/factory/packages/<name>/category`
  `{"category"}` — at review, or any time after; the change is a
  `category` line in the journal with who and from what. A settled
  category is never overwritten by a later audit.
- It travels with the package: `GET /api/v1/factory/packages`, the
  package page (*who stands behind it*), the profile's package list and
  the seal (`category`). It says where to look, never who may approve.

The project's recipes live flat, `factory/pkgbuilds/<name>/`, owned by
every maintainer (`CODEOWNERS`, generated from the governance file); the
sizing recipes — measured by hand, never queued — under `factory/sizing/`.
The live list of maintainers is on the dashboard's
[Governance](https://omarchy-pool.firemanxbr.org/docs/governance) page and
at `GET /api/v1/factory/maintainers`.

## What a maintainer does

- Reads a contributor's staged build — PKGBUILD, log, PKGINFO, the gate,
  the audit — and either rejects it with a note or has **the project
  build it** (`POST /factory/tasks/:id/build`): a review worker, the
  project's agent, the project's own recipe, the same gate, staged.
- Approves or rejects **the project's build**, with its evidence in
  front of them. An approval is the decision, on the record with a name,
  and the publish job: the project's package into `edge`, signed by the
  pool, the registration `published`, the seal written next to the
  object. **Never their own package**: a maintainer who brought a package
  is its contributor, and another maintainer has it built and approves it
  (conflict of interest, refused by the pool). A project with a single
  maintainer is no exception: that maintainer's own packages wait for a
  second one — which is why the project needs two.
- Settles each package's category (*Categories, not groups*).
- Reviews pull requests touching `factory/pkgbuilds/` (a new recipe of the
  project's own, a version bump).
- Vouches for a worker as a project worker (`POST /factory/workers/:id/trust`)
  — with a second maintainer: one proposes, another confirms, never the
  worker's owner; the trust is a signed record. One maintainer takes it back.
- Blocks a contributor or a package when the evidence says so, with the
  reason on the record (*Blocking*, below).
- Reviews governance pull requests: this file's changes.

## Blocking

The brake. It is on the Review page, *Blocks*, and in the API; it takes a
maintainer and a reason of at least four characters, and the reason is
what the record and the contributor see.

**A blocked contributor** (`POST /factory/contributors/<login>/block`)
gets nothing more in: no package request, no build, no worker
registration — the pool answers `403` with the reason. Their workers are
revoked at once, their queued and running tasks cancelled, their
registrations rejected and their packages pulled from every ring
(a release per architecture, rendered by a pool worker). Their projects
and source URLs stay closed: a new account asking for the same project or
the same tarball gets `403 requested by <login>, who is blocked` — a fresh
login does not open the door again. A maintainer cannot block themself
or another maintainer; the latter is a governance pull request removing
the name from `factory/MAINTAINERS.toml`.

**A blocked package** (`POST /factory/packages/<name>/block`) leaves every
ring the same way, its tasks are cancelled and its registration is
`rejected`; the project URL answers `403` to any new request until the
block is lifted.

**Lifting** (`…/unblock`, a reason again) is by **another** maintainer,
never the one who blocked — the same two-person rule as the approval.
Lifting a contributor restores nothing: their workers register again,
their packages are requested again, and everything goes through the gate
and the review as if for the first time.

Every block and every lift is a signed record in the public bucket —
`contributors/<login>/block-<stamp>.json`, `…/unblock-<stamp>.json`,
`factory/<name>/<request>/decision-<stamp>.json` — with who, when and
why; `GET /api/v1/factory/blocks` lists what is in force.

## The project's workers

Machines two maintainers vouched for — never the owner's word alone, the
trust a signed record, one maintainer enough to take it back. They only do
what a maintainer would: the pool's jobs (sync, promote, health, security,
gc), the audit of a staged build, the project's own build of a reviewed
package and the build of the recipes on `main`. They never build from a
contributor's staged artifact, and never pull a new package that has no
evidence and no review yet — that is a contributor's worker's job. The
Review page names the worker and the host behind every build.

The project runs them as two roles of the same image, and a third for the
community (`OMARCHY_WORKER_ROLE`, [factory/README.md](../factory/README.md)
*Three roles*): a **pool** worker takes the pool's jobs and nothing else; a
**review** worker takes the maintainers' work and nothing else — the
build of the recipes maintainers merge and the audit of every staged build
(the second agent); a shared **community** worker builds contributors' packages and
drafts package requests with an agent key its owner brought — as a pair:
a **broker** that holds the token and the key and runs no build, and a
**builder** born with nothing (SECURITY.md, *Isolation*). The split keeps
the maintainers' agent and the contributors' agent apart, and a container
that is not a review worker never audits.

## Becoming a maintainer

1. **Contribute first.** Every maintainer was a contributor: packages
   registered, builds staged, reviews taken part in. The record is public on
   the Factory page.
2. **A maintainer proposes you** — a pull request adding your login to
   `factory/MAINTAINERS.toml`, saying why. It is a decision people
   make, not a database write.
3. **Another maintainer approves.** The file (and `CODEOWNERS`, generated
   from it) is owned by every maintainer and `main` requires a code-owner
   review, so at least one *other* maintainer approves; nothing about it is
   auto-merged. The merge is the promotion: within ten minutes the pool
   applies it and the next sign-in shows the role.

A maintainer stepping down is the same pull request with the same
review. Run `factory/bin/check-governance --write` in
that pull request to regenerate `CODEOWNERS`; CI fails when the two
disagree.

**Bootstrap.** While the project has a single maintainer there is nobody
else to approve *the pull request that adds the second one*: that
maintainer merges it alone, and GitHub records the bypassed review. The
exception ends the moment a second maintainer exists, and it never
extended to packages — a sole maintainer's own packages wait.

## Workers, compute and agents

- **One image, one command, for everyone**: `ghcr.io/firemanxbr/omarchy-worker`.
  There is no technical difference between a contributor's container and a
  maintainer's; the registration behind the token decides. Community trust
  (every registration starts here) builds the owner's packages inside the
  container and never sees a package in review; project trust (two
  maintainers' word on the registration, never its owner's) runs the pool's
  jobs and the rebuild of approved packages in fresh sibling containers. A maintainer
  who also contributes registers a second, untrusted worker.
- A registered worker builds **its owner's packages** and nothing else.
  Donating compute to everyone's builds is a maintainer's call: the
  project's shared community workers are the ones maintainers run
  (`WORKER_SHARED=1` on the container, `--shared` on `pkg-repo work`); a
  contributor's worker is never shared, whatever flag it starts with — the
  pool ignores it. Nobody's laptop ends up busy with strangers' packages,
  and no stranger's machine ends up building for everyone.
- **Ready is not online.** A worker is ready for the work it declares
  when it is alive *and* what that work needs answers: a build or an
  audit needs an agent that replies. A key set is not an agent that
  works — no credit, a revoked token, a dead endpoint, a retired model —
  so the worker probes its agent (`factory/bin/agent.py --probe`, one tiny
  completion) at start and every thirty minutes, and says so with every
  claim. The pool hands a draft or an audit only to a worker whose agent
  answered, and the People page shows each worker's agent and whether it
  answers. The pool's own jobs (sync, promote, health, security, gc) need
  no agent and are not gated by one.
- **Agent keys stay with the worker's owner — and out of the build.** A
  worker that drafts or corrects PKGBUILDs with an agent (community trust),
  or audits staged builds for the maintainers (project trust), gets the
  owner's key — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`,
  `XAI_API_KEY` or a Claude subscription's `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
  (`factory/bin/agent.py`; `FACTORY_MODEL` picks the model) — on the
  **broker**, the one process on the host that holds credentials and runs
  no build; the builder speaks to it in the Anthropic Messages shape and
  never sees the key. The worker reports *which* agent really answers
  (`claude-code/claude-sonnet-5`, `openai/gpt-5`, …) so the Factory page
  can show it. The pool holds no agent key and GitHub runs no agent —
  nothing of the pipeline runs there; what an agent produces is evidence
  like any other build, reviewed by a maintainer before it reaches anyone.
  A build is somebody else's code and its log is public: *the build sees
  nothing the log cannot show*, and the pool refuses a log that carries
  what looks like a secret.
- **Package requests** are made on the dashboard, on the record; the
  build a contributor asks for goes to the project's shared community
  workers (the project's agent) or to the contributor's own worker (their
  agent). No ready worker, no draft: the request waits, visibly, on the
  Factory page.

## Bumps and packages nobody builds

A new upstream release of an approved package is built the way the first
version was — on the owner's worker, as evidence a maintainer reviews. Once
a day the pool queues that build (`bump:<task>@<tag>`: the contributor's
staged PKGBUILD with `pkgver` moved to the tag; evidence again, never the
product). The owner's worker has **14 days**; after that any `--shared`
worker may build it. **30 days** without a build and the package is
*unmaintained*: no more bumps until its owner builds again, or a
maintainer removes the registration so someone else can take the name.
The project's recipes (`factory/pkgbuilds/<name>/`, the maintainers' own
and the ones written from contributors' evidence) are bumped by pull
request — `factory-update.yml` opens one per package — reviewed by a
maintainer, never auto-merged.

## The record

Role changes are `role` events, approvals are rows a maintainer signed with
their login (`GET /api/v1/factory/approvals`), trust decisions are `trust`
events, blocks and their lifting are signed records in the public bucket
(*Blocking*). The file's history on GitHub is the history of who decided what.

### Track record

A profile (`/user/<login>`, `GET /api/v1/users/<login>` → `record`) sums
that record, so it says how much work a person has done here — not who
they are. As a contributor: distinct packages a maintainer let in, builds
that produced evidence (staged), of which bumps, builds their workers did
for other people (donated compute), rejections. As a maintainer:
approvals, rejections, and approvals whose project rebuild then failed.
One number, so that the formula is public and dull:

```
score = 3·let in + staged + bumps + for others − 2·rejected      (contributed)
      + 2·approvals + rejections − 3·rebuilds failed              (maintained)
```

It is one number on a profile and nothing else: no rank, no badge, no
threshold. Becoming a maintainer is still a pull request another
maintainer approves, with this record as one thing they look at.
