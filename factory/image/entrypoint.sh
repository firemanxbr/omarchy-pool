# omarchy-worker — one image, one command, for contributors and maintainers.
#
# The registration behind OMARCHY_WORKER_TOKEN decides what this container
# does; nothing else differs between a contributor's machine and a
# maintainer's:
#
#   community trust  → the contributor's worker: one task per container,
#                      built right here, the result into the contributor's
#                      staging workspace (WORKER_SHARED=1 builds anyone's,
#                      an agent key — ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY,
#                      GEMINI_API_KEY or XAI_API_KEY, or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN for
#                      a Claude subscription — brings the owner's agent).
#   project trust    → the project's worker: the pool's jobs and the rebuild
#                      of approved packages, each in a fresh sibling
#                      container through the runtime's socket mounted at
#                      /var/run/docker.sock (docs: /docs/workers); with an
#                      agent key it also audits staged builds for the
#                      maintainers (the second agent).
#
# OMARCHY_WORKER_ROLE names one of the three containers the project runs
# (docs: /docs/workers — *The three roles*), and is optional: without it the
# trust decides everything, as above. With it:
#
#   pool       a project worker for the pool's own jobs only — sync, render,
#              promote, rollback, health, security, enqueue, gc, verify;
#              never a build, never an audit. No agent key needed.
#   review     a project worker for the maintainers' work only — the rebuild
#              of approved packages and the audit of staged builds (the
#              second agent, so it wants an agent key); never a pool job.
#   community  a shared community worker: builds anyone's community
#              packages, drafts PKGBUILDs for package requests with its
#              owner's agent key (WORKER_SHARED=1 is implied).
#   broker     no build here: the one process on this host that holds the
#              credentials (factory/bin/broker, :8790) — the worker's token,
#              the agent's key, GITHUB_TOKEN — and only receives, processes
#              and answers: the pool's calls for the one task it claimed,
#              the agent, GitHub read-only. A community builder runs beside
#              it with OMARCHY_BROKER=http://broker:8790 and nothing else.
#              `agent` is the same role without a worker token: the agent
#              and GitHub served to build containers that cannot run the
#              agent themselves (the project's review builds; the emulated
#              x86_64 worker, where Claude Code's binary dies under qemu).
#
# OMARCHY_BROKER makes this container a builder: it holds no token and no
# key, asks the broker who it is, builds one task and exits (/docs/security-model,
# *Isolation*; /docs/workers#secrets).
#
# A role reports itself in the worker's labels ("role"), so the Factory page
# shows what each container is for. Extra arguments go to `pkg-repo work`
# in project mode (--idle-exit, --once; --kind and --labels are the role's
# when a role is set); in community mode they are ignored.
