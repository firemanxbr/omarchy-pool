# rollout.sh — a rolling upgrade of the six workers to the image the pool's
# latest release published: what Kubernetes calls a rolling update, at the
# size of one host.
#
# For each service whose image changed, one at a time: stop the running
# container — SIGTERM, which the worker takes as *drain*: it finishes the
# task it holds, reports it, claims nothing new and exits (up to the
# compose file's stop_grace_period) — and start one from the new image.
# The other five keep working meanwhile; no task is ever killed, none is
# handed to another worker by an expired lease. Nothing to do when nothing
# changed, so a timer may run this every few minutes (setup.sh installs
# one: omarchy-pool-rollout.timer, every 15 minutes).
#
#   ./rollout.sh            upgrade what changed
#   ./rollout.sh --check    say what would change, change nothing

# without the group re-enters with it; anyone else hears why.
